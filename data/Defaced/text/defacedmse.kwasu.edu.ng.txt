Thus, the department will provide: a. State-of-art technological and engineering training that prepares the graduates for the responsibilities of the workplace. b. Qualified and competent Materials Engineers in such areas of specialization as – Nanotechnology, Mineral Processing, Extractive Metallurgy, Corrosion Technology, Production Engineering, Foundry Technology, Materials development, and modeling Solid Mechanics/Design. c. Industry-institution linkages for mutually beneficial relationships. d. A Centre of Excellence in Materials Engineering where expertise and facilities to accelerate the pace of industrial development can be provided. Vision The vision of the department is to become one of the best in Nigeria with national and international acclaim. It will be a department where the advancement of engineering and technology is continuously dynamic. Its graduates will become very capable and environmentally friendly engineers who would be relevant in the public and private sectors of the economy for the rapid industrialization and development of Nigeria. Brief History of the Department The Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kwara State University was established in 2010. The National Universities Commission (NUC), after a resource verification visit, officially approved the establishment of the department in 2013 to run a programme for the award of a B. Eng. degree in Materials Science and Engineering. Actual teaching started in August 2011 with the admission of eight (8) foundation students with three (3) members of staff. In 2016, the department was given the status of "Full accreditation" by the NUC. The department turned out it first set of graduates in June 2016. After a successful resource verification visit in 2021, the NUC approved the commencement of the postgraduate programmes in Materials Science and Engineering. In the 2021/2022 academic session, the department admitted its first set of students for the MSc. and Ph.D. programmes in Materials Science and Engineering. Our Work OUR WORK The program provides students with a framework for understanding and designing materials and systems for multiple functions. Stimulate instincts for innovation based on a sound foundation in engineering science principles. We expect students to understand the abstractions related to multifunctional materials and systems. These include (a) materials and devices; (b) energy conversion; (c) structure/property relations; (f) modeling and algorithms; (g) transport phenomena; (h) design and production systems, (i) materials extraction and production; (j) materials development and modeling, and (k) environmental impact. The pedagogy is that of an engineering science approach complemented by exposure to a range of approaches to multifunctional design and production. The objective is to provide students with the ability to solve structured problems and develop creative solutions to a wide range of unstructured materials engineering problems. The main objectives of the program include, but are not limited to: provide the necessary high-level manpower for metals and materials industries that are rapidly developing; provide Materials Engineers capable of effecting changes to imported technologies to meet local needs through research and development; provide manpower for the development and sustenance of materials science and engineering programs in the nation's institution of higher learning; train graduates who are self-sufficient as job providers and serve the parts needs of our industries; provide a solid base for the pursuit of higher degrees (M.Sc., Ph.D.); identify the limitations of our students and make a real effort at providing compensating corrective measures and, make continuous reappraisal of our curriculum to ensure its consistency with the goal of the training for national development within the allowed parameters of time and resources. DIRECTOR'S WELCOME ADDRESS Welcome to the Materials Science and Engineering Programme at Kwara State University, Malete. Through this programme, we offer you an opportunity to gain expertise in the field of materials science and materials engineering, an area that underpins the development of several technologically relevant fields. Our programme is designed to provide you with a strong foundation in materials science, while also exposing you to cutting-edge research and advances in materials engineering. Our interdisciplinary curriculum aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, focusing on developing a deep understanding of materials properties, behaviour, processing, and applications. Furthermore, we provide ample opportunities for hands-on experience in our state-of-the-art laboratories, where you can work on exciting projects under the mentorship of our experienced faculties. At the end of the programme, students will be equipped to tackle the scientific and technological challenges of the materials industry, academia, and research. The programme is also designed to enable transition easily into pursuing higher studies in materials engineering and allied fields. Prof. Abdul Ganiyu F.
