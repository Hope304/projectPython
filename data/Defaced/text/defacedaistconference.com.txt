Last five Conference witnessed a number of Expert Researchers, Academicians and Industry Practioners in AI and Speech Domain from premier Institutions in India and abroad including Japan, Australia, France, Germany, Hungary, Czech Republic, Myanmar, Uzbekistan, Austria, Vietnam and others. Thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning(ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Technology, which are enabling the development of Virtual Assistants in user-facing applications and working in the background to automate workflows. AI driven solutions like speech recognition systems are more accurate and efficient and makes it easier to identify and understand the components of natural language. These models can be used for voice recognition services, making an NLP service well-rounded and more efficient for various domain including medical (e.g. speech impaired people), forensics and academics and others. Conference will involve Paper presentations, Tutorials and Key Note Speeches by Eminent Personalities on these technologies. About the Tutorial on Deep Learning and Speech Technology In parallel to AIST2024, tutorials on Deep Learning and Speech Technology will also be organised during the Conference. Hands on Sessions along with strong conceptual knowledge will be conducted by senior Academicians, Researchers and Practioners on these technologies. There is no participation fee for attending the Tutorial for authors and delegates. A separate Participation Certificate will be awarded to all the participants. PROCEEDINGS Supported By Proceedings will be submitted to Springer in their Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series (indexed by SCOPUS and WoS) for possible publication. Call For Papers Like the previous five versions, 6th AIST 2024 is dedicated to cutting edge research that addresses scientific needs of academic researchers and industrial professionals to explore new horizons of knowledge related to Artificial Intelligence and Speech Technologies.
