Starting in academia established my foundation in scientific rigor, logistics of research recruitment, complex data management, and especially a drive to understand how people think. ​ I transitioned to the world of experience design through my graduate program in human-computer interaction. This training exposed me to industry innovators and diverse, inspiring colleagues. More importantly, I started to see a path where I could apply scientific thought while also flexing my creativity. ​ Since then I've been working at a small but acclaimed independent digital agency, rapidly gaining real-world experience across a range of industries and project types. I've become accustomed to fast-paced problem-solving, working with cross-disciplinary teams, and communicating evidence-based design solutions.Masters of Human-Computer InteractionBiological Basis of Behavior MajorClients I've worked withBut most importantly... I'm lucky enough to live with an incredible wife, ridiculous cat, and hilarious 2-year-old son ​ I'm a lover of the outdoors and aimless exploration, through running, hiking, travel, or however I can make it happen ​ I get excited chills from live music, strange films, and new & compelling ideas ​ I'm at terms with the fact that I'll never have it fully figured out - as a designer, as a father, and as a human being - best thing to do is keep learning with an open mind & flexible attitude ​ I was born, raised, and began my adult life in Philadelphia. I started a family and a UX career in Pittsburgh. Where will we go next and what exciting steps will take place there? Stay tuned, I guess...
