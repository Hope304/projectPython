Rubaida KanomI love this product! I got it as a gift for my mother and she loved it. It was made with good material and looks very good! Worth every penny Hamad KhanI bought these as a fathers day gift for someone. They seem like they are made with care. The beads are beautiful as seem very durable. Each bead has both Allah and Muhammad engraved on them. I got the grey beads with black engraving on them and they are so gorgeous. I would definitely purchase this item again. Ahmad AliI bought Tasbih Counter, it works very well and easy to use.
