The choice Enniya.The optimal period of insemination is the period most favorable for meeting sperm with an egg.When choosing the period of insemination with artificial insemination, three factors play a role: firstly, the ability of the egg for fertilization is quite limited (approximately 5-10 hours).After that, the egg is aging, which reduces its probability of merging with sperm and increases the likelihood of abnormal development and death.This circumstance determines the fact that the sperm at the time of ovulation of the egg should already be in the sexual routes of the animal.Secondly, the studies have shown that in order to connect sperm with the egg, the sperm itself needs to go through a certain preparatory procedure called capacitation in the genital tract.This is a kind of preparatory procedure for the preparation of external sperm structures for the passage of the crown of the radiator of the egg.The duration of this procedure in agricultural animals is approximately 5-6 hours.This circumstance requires the need to introduce sperm into the genital tract of cows 5-6 hours before the alleged ovulation.Thirdly, the viability of sperm in the genital tract of the female with a natural coating by the male is, on average, 24-48 hours.The viability of frozen-coated or freshly exposed sperms is much lower, on average, 12 hours.This fact requires the introduction of sperm no more than 12 hours before the alleged ovulation.The indicated three factors determine the need for accurate knowledge of the time of ovulation of a pre -proper follicle in cows and heifers, pigs.In females of cattle, unlike other types of agricultural animals, ovulation occurs in the braking stage, 10-12 hours after the end of sexual hunting, in 80% of animals in the early morning hours (3-4 hours in the morning).All these factors determine the optimal period of artificial insemination of cows and heifers at the end of sexual hunting.Since in 70% of animals the average duration of sexual hunting is 12 hours (with fluctuations from 8 to 20 hours), then if the start of the hunt falls in the morning, such animals are inseminated in the evening (at 17-19 o’clock in the evening).If the beginning of the hunt is fixed in the evening, such animals are inseminated early in the morning (at 5-6 in the morning).During the insemination of the dairy cows, the following rule should be observed: - to inseminate to the milking or two hours after it.This is due to the fact that when milking in the brain, a dominant occurs, which prevents the absorption of the cervix, which reduces the effectiveness of artificial insemination.An important factor in fruitful insemination of animals along with the choice of insemination time is the multiplicity of insemination.In accordance with the instructions of cows and heifers, they are inseminated twice: the first time after they identify sexual hunting and the second time after 10-12 hours.In the case of the continuation of the hunt, additional insemination is carried out every 12 hours, up to the end of signs of sexual hunting.Next: Morozov’s heating table, biological thermostat.Up>
