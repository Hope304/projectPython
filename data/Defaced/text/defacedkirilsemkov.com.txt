I work within wide range of projects such as corporate identities, interactive websites and printed media. Love modeling and making things with my hands. I’m also interested in typography since I was little. Making typefaces with bulgarian cyrilic, which you will be able to download free when they’re finished ;) You can check out my projects, some of which are made during my study in the university, some are during my work experience where I developed my professional skills, some are in my spare time or for a present. You can also chek out my work experince, the companies and projects that I worked on, as well as all my skills in the ABOUT section. For the building of this site I have to thank my close friend Trayan Ivanov for his developer skills. Cheers!
