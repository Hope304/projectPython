HDPE geomembrans, geosynthetics and waterproofing -beginning -hydro Trade Ltd.»Home PVC and TPO membranes, geotextiles, geoms, HDPE geomembrans, asphalt-army network.Hydro Trade specializes in the following two directions: - Import and trade in geosynthetic materials from leading European manufacturers - supply of materials and performing waterproofing with PVC, TPO and bitumen membrane waterproofing membranes with which we work are: ◊ PVC membranes - FAT - FAT - FAT- Czech Republic ◊ TRA membranes - Texsalon - Spain reinforced membranes for mechanical fixation;Unarmed and homogeneous membranes;Membrans for drinking tanks and artificial reservoirs.Mineral stone wool:- density 100kg/m3- compressive strength CS (10) 30kpa, point load pl (5) 300N- density 115kg/m3- compressive strength CS (10) 35kpa, point load pl (5) 350N- density- density150kg/m3 - compressive strength CS (10) 50kpa, point load PL (5) 500N - density 170kg/m3 - compressive strength CS (10) 60kpa, point load pl (5) 600N schedules - 2000 x 1200 - 1200x 1000 - 1000 x 600 debbels from 40 to 200mmm to 15 days after order!No restriction on deliveries! In the field of waterproofing works, we specialize in the construction of complete waterproofing systems and flat roofs with appeal, while at the same time we are direct importers of all materials and components from established manufacturers.In the field of geosynthetics we work with several groups of materials: ◊ HDPE / LDPE Geomembrans from - Warter Polymers - Poland - Rowad International Geosynthetics - Saudi Arabia thickness from 0.75mm to 2.5mm;Rollers width from 5.30 to 8,00m;Smooth, one -sided and bilateral textured or structured;Ability to produce a specific thickness on request.HDPE Geomembrans are manufactured using three -layer technology and meet the requirements of GRI GM 13 to polymer geosynthetic membranes definitions of Geosynthetics Institute of Texas Research International Company.specific requirements set.LDPE Geomembrans are available in four main thicknesses - 0.75 / 1.0 / 1.5 and 2.0mm. The geotextiles offered by us are the following types: ◊ Polypropylene geotextile - Thrace plastics - Greece Polypropylene Non -woven acin -inserted geotextiles;Polypropylene tissues of high -quality geotextiles;Volume weight from 130 g/m2 to 2000 g/m2.◊ Polyester geotextile - Minet S.A.- Romania polyester non -woven acidic geotextiles;Volume weight from 110 g/m2 to 1200 g/m2.Another group of products with extremely good qualities and widespread use in construction works, terrestrial activities and modern road rehabilitation are: ◊ Geomers - polypropylene, polyester and PVA polypropylene extruded high -strength geom;Biaxial with different sizes of openings;Strength characteristics from 15 to 100 kN/m.◊ asphalt -army networks - open structure or composites Glass -grained biaxial high -strength mesh with EVA coating;Strength characteristics from 50 to 100 kN/m;Structure - open cells, mesh or with geotextile.All the materials and products we offer are ISO certified and their technical specifications meet the EN standards, with the indicators of some of them significantly exceeding the specified norms and requirements.We have qualified specialists in order to professionally carry out all consultations and engineering activities regarding the bidding of the products, as well as with trained staff in order to carry out qualitatively and on time the assigned works.HDPE Geomembranigraniextile - PolypropyleneGiotti - PolyestergeoM -PP, PP, PVAAASFALTO -ARMING NETWORK 6 630 390 Social Facebook Twitter YouTubeCOPYRIGHT © Hydrerade Ltd. • Admin •
