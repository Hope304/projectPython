Classmate |Home on the Day of this site is intended to keep information on a community that rise and bowed to several decades around the turn of the 1900s on Kljáströnd in Höfðahverfi.There lived my grandfather and grandmother, Ólafur Gunnarsson and Anna María Vigfúsdóttir for the longest part of her life and ran home and fishing and raised a large group of children in a cohabitation with sister Olaf, Guðríður Gunnarsdóttir and her husband, Sigurður Ringested.When the activity on the culprit was at its peak, there were 60 people in residents, and a lot of loose men were made, at least.Eight motorboats, as well as a store and a physician for the area.There were playful bells and plays were set up.This was the first indicator of a village in the Grýtubakkahreppur and built the results of seafaring and fish processing.The activities probably peaked around 1915. During the booming period, the Kljástrandar fishery employees sees a house on the meadows nearby that was deserted 20 years later.From the 1920s, a decline, which ended in 1940, began that no motorboat was left after the port at Höfstastakk was discontinued due to Grynings and the bankruptcy bankruptcy.The settlement was then deserted in 1951 when grandfather and grandmother moved to Akureyri, Sigurður went in the weather the year before and Guðríður moved away the same year.Signs of this settlement are still clear in the ruins of the houses on the Kláströnd.Moberg, which is one of the grasses in the vicinity, was recently leveled on the ground and is now covered with a grassy meadow in Cape Town.The walls of the Brotherhood were killed a few years ago and the walls of other ruins are constantly moving down.After a few decades, the traces will disappear in full.Ólafur Gunnarsson Anna María Vigfúsdóttir Documents On the site you can find a collection of newspaper articles and other documents related to the lost community on Kljáströnd.More articles More photos are in contact with the site, Ólafur Gunnarsson, son of Þóra Soffía Ólafsdóttir and Gunnar Héðinn Stefánsson.His son, Gunnar Birnir Ólafsson, took care of the type and design of the website.If you have any comments or suggestions, please contact us.Ólafur Gunnarsson oligunn59@gmail.com Gunnar Birnir Ólafsson Gunnarbirni@gmail.com links photos documents home Akureyri boats in Eyjafjörður Eyjafjarðarsveit Fjordungar Grenivík Kljáströnd on Flickr
