News & Press Releases Keynote Talk from CEB Transforming Healthcare Using Deep Data and Remote Monitoring Dr. Michael Snyder has pioneered the use of “big data” and multiomics to advance scientific discovery and transform healthcare. His application of omics and wearables technologies to perform longitudinal profiling of people when they are healthy and ill is transforming medicine and healthcare. Indeed, his laboratory’s recent work to use smartwatches and wearables to detect illness, including infectious disease such as COVID-19, prior to symptom onset is being used by many thousands of people. Featured Talk from the Conference TAVO412 - A Novel Trispecific cMet x EGFR x VEGF Antibody for Difficult-to-treat Cancers During the CEB-23 meeting, Dr. Mark Chiu, CSO, Tavotek Biotherapeutics, presented TAVO412 a novel trispecific antibody that targets and binds to c-Met, EGFR and VEGF. The binding of TAVO412 to c-Met and EGFR expressed on tumor cells prevents receptor phosphorylation. This prevents the activation of both c-Met- and EGFR-mediated signaling pathways. The binding of TAVO412 to VEGF prevents both its binding to VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and VEGF/VEGFR-mediated signaling. This inhibits the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and prevents the growth and maintenance of tumor blood vessels, which leads to tumor cell death.

From the Board New Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy We are pleased to share the news that Dr. Sayon Roy and his team at Boston University School of Medicine identified a possible new treatment for diabetic retinopathy. The study found hyperglycemic and diabetic conditions increase LOX-PP levels and promote retinal dysfunction associated with the development of vascular lesions in diabetic retinopathy. The work has been featured as Editor’s Choice article and published in September 2019 issue of The American Journal of Pathology... Latest Research Ketogenic Diet Meal Replacement Treatment of Obesity-Related T2D Ketogenic diets are low carbohydrate diets which have been used increasingly in treating obesity.
