Daoming Technology-Dedicated to become the leader of global fruit and vegetable preservation technology, telephone consultation 13523717444 plus WeChat consultation homepage solution project significance.Solutions solution, Yunbao Fresh Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Life Science, AI, Internet of Things, Electrification, fluid machinery and other core technologies, and build a software and hardware integrated storage and preservation technology solution for the origin of the producing cold storage.Supported by intelligent equipment, the AI fresh -keeping model is the core. Based on fruit and vegetable life science, it uses decompression gas to store fresh -keeping technology to allow fruits and vegetables to enter a healthy dormant state, extend fruit and vegetable preservation time, and create good social and economic value.The significance of the Project Significance project reduces loss and waste. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, my country is the world's largest fruit producer. However, my country's fruit and vegetable loss rate is 20-30%, as high as 100 million tons, and economic losses of 75 billion yuan.High loss of fruits and vegetables is caused by reasons such as backward storage and preservation techniques and inadequate storage conditions. Among them, the freshness of fruit and vegetable preservation throughout the process, so the problem of fresh -keeping problems has become the key point of reducing the loss of fruit and vegetables, which is also the pain point.With the development of social health, with the development of society, people's quality requirements for fruits and vegetables are getting higher and higher.Factors such as freshness, health and environmental protection have greatly affected people's willingness to buy.Fruit and vegetable rot can produce yellow glocrats, which causes serious harm to human health. In 1993, pinealine toxin was designated as a type of carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO) cancer research institution, which was extremely toxic and toxic substances.Storage and preservation technology development is far -reaching for human health to ensure the annual supply of the market due to the annual sales of agricultural products."Dan" needs to meet the storage needs of various fruits and vegetables by continuously innovating and storing fresh -keeping technology to ensure the annual supply of the market.Some areas in the world in the world are facing the shortage of agricultural products. In the least developed countries, about 800 million people are facing diseases and health problems due to severe hunger and malnutrition. my country is a major fruit and vegetable production country, and the production of fruits and vegetables ranks among the forefront of the world.According to a research report on the Ai Media Data Center, about 130 million tons of vegetables and 12 million tons of fruits in my country each year, the fruits and vegetables consumed by rot can meet the basic nutritional needs of nearly 200 million people.Daosheng Technology hopes that through cloud preservation technology, in order to reduce the consumption and rotten of fruit and vegetables around the world, it is hungry with human beings, and the CONY Profile company introduces that Daoming Technology was established in 2018.
