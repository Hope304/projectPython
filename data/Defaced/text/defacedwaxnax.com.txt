Our Story Customer Testimonials “I love WaxNax because it helped me show many patients the beauty of properly dosing concentrates. This products helps you conserve your concentrates and preserves the terpenes that can often be scorched due to direct heating of the banger or quartz nails. This is a revolutionary product that I believe every patient on the market can benefit from.” Professor DabzOfficial High Times Magazine Cannabis Cup Judge “Very convenient, it simplifies dabbing and make’s it more of a measured and consistence experience! New and experienced user’s have been waiting for something like this for a long time.” JeremiahOwner, Positive Vibes “WaxNax inserts make my dabbing experience quality consuming every single time! I always get the most out of my concentrates with no wasted product. The terpene profile of each flavor is definitely enhanced with a very savory hit and I can pack my WaxNax inserts everywhere where I go with their easy portable inserts including lids.” MarisolMulti Media Artist (@Sol1477) “I want to thank you guys for a product that I can finally find comfort in using in accordance with my concentrates!! A clean extraction, quick access to my preferred like of the day via your durable ease use case, which I can store all my daily dab strains with comfort of nothing lost! Always a clinch to clean and restore both products and my dabbing apparatus!” Larry IrbyMarketer & Promoter “They are portable, discreet, clean. The caps are a great addition as pre-loading inserts is a breeze an no worries of leaking out. They are easily slipped into a pocket, backpack or portfolio. The cleaner, longer lasting banger is a huge win, as the scorch, burn and constant wipe is all but eliminated. Social use pieces last longer cleaner and taste better.” Len ArchuletaOwner, Emerald Zoo Previous Next 3483 E Eaton RoadChico, CA 95973 bryan@waxnax.com (828) 707-3981 Instagram Linkedin Twitter Youtube $0.00 0 Cart Shop All Concentrate Packaging: Dab Jars & Concentrate Containers Combo Kits: Wax Pens, Dab Jars & Dab Tool Kits Quartz Bangers Clothing & Merch Pet Products Cart Shop All Concentrate Packaging: Dab Jars & Concentrate Containers Combo Kits: Wax Pens, Dab Jars & Dab Tool Kits Quartz Bangers Clothing & Merch Pet Products Cart How It Works Our Mission Benefits FAQ The Dab Digest Contact Partners Wholesale How It Works Our Mission Benefits FAQ The Dab Digest Contact Partners Wholesale Privacy Policy Refund & Returns Policy Shipping & Returns Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Refund & Returns Policy Shipping & Returns Terms & Conditions Like Discounts?
