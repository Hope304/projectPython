employment referral business Paid employment business business license number: 22-Yu-300619 ■ subsidy support business Home subsidy support company inquiry companyWe are a general local small and medium -sized business to know what to do with representative greeting job seekers.It is not a big company, and it does not have special strengths such as special technology and knowledge.It may be difficult to innovate a business model with a dream and contribute to the new value to society.Therefore, we are working hard on debt -free management.The business expansion pace is slowly and slowly.It doesn't look like an urban emerging IT company.I don't know if there is a sales, overtime gutsli, or a holiday that has a greasy momentum, but the salary is high.I yearn for such a dreamy way of life, but we chose a way of life that was just enough to maintain a reasonably reasonable life.Many companies have not been able to comply with the law, just as the commonplace is a black company.・ Minimum wage, service overtime, Labor Standards Law, less than the number of days of holidays, paid vacation that cannot be taken, non -joined social insurance, employment insurance, and workers' accident insurance that can not be used?There is no such thing at our company.However, there are many things that employees have not been able to do, such as regular reports and documents within the deadline.If employees have been able to comply with employment rules and in -house rules, we promise to comply with the law.Given the retirement allowance of nearly 20 million yen in Japan, it is necessary to think about the 70 -year -old retirement year realistically.In 2019, the topic of shortage of 20 million yen in retirement was also exciting.Also, in modern Japan, it may not be realistic to work through a life in one company.Nevertheless, we aim to work together for a long time.Therefore, we set the goal of retirement allowance 20 million yen.It is not a goal of a small and medium -sized business, but a realistic number of 20 million yen.Please pay attention to the special counter on the website.President and CEO Yuki Mizushima Corporate Information Company MNS Office
