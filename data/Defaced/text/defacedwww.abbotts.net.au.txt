He’s helped me obtain finance for a few of my properties and I always call Bez to discuss the figures before I act on a new purchase. He is reliable and always willing to discuss matters with me - this gives me peace of mind before I take the next step!"Brent and Shelley SandersBaldivis, Western Australia "Abbotts Finance Brokers assisted us with a complex bridging finance transaction that included multiple properties. We found Bez very professional, knowledgably and an excellent communicator. He handled all aspects of the finance process and turned a potentially stressful and complex transaction into a well-managed process. We have no hesitation in recommending Bez to others and hope to use the services of Abbotts Finance Brokers in the future."Rosa and SimonScarborough, Western Australia "I have been a client of Abbotts since 1989. I have always received great service and expert advice both when I owned a small business and more recently as a salary earner with some property investments.One of the reasons for my small business succeeding was Brad’s accountancy skills and sage advice. Gabby has also been fantastic and understands my financial situation and looks after my accounting affairs very efficiently. Not only that I enjoy my relatively infrequent meetings with Brad and Gabby, I feel like I’m more than a customer to them."Peter BentleyMedical Service Manager (Australian Red Cross Blood Service) See more testimonials Affiliations Talk to a Specialist or send us a message What kind of difference can we make to you and your business?
