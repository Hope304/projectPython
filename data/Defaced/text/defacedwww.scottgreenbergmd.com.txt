Read More About Jessie K. ChanHear From Our Happy Patients “Dr. Greenberg's staff was very friendly and courteous. Dr. Greenberg was very thorough in explaining the procedure to me and answered all of the questions I had. The only thing that would stop me from proceeding with Dr. Greenberg is the price I was quoted. It's quite a bit more than I'd researched and more than I have been quoted by other surgeons.”* "My experience was great, the staff was extremely friendly and down to Earth, and it made me feel welcomed. Jen was very informative, and went above and beyond to not only make me feel comfortable, but also explain all of my options in detail."* "The staff made me feel extremely comfortable and welcome. Dr. Greenberg knew exactly everything that he was talking about and gave me his honest opinion. In addition, he answered my questions thoroughly and gave me an idea of what the surgery would be like."* *Individual results may vary.
