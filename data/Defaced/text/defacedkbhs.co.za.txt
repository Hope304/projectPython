Founded in 1887 the school has a proud heritage. Maintaining traditions of the past and evolving with the times is a crucial part of what the school stands for. The school emphasises values such as academic excellence, for which due recognition is given and social conscience and respect for the dignity and rights of others, among others. Our learners are urged to take part in sport and cultural as well as community activities. The school activities calendar is extensive and assures that our learners experience so much more in their schooling environment, in the five years they spend within Kimberley Boys’ High School care. The school is the only boys’ school in Kimberley and the Northern Cape and that sets it apart from other educational institutions which offer a co- education. We are pleased that the choice exists and are proud to be offering an excellent level of education to those who are attracted to our particular offering. The founding fathers of Kimberley Boys’ High were very familiar with rough and polished diamonds Kimberley was famous for. So too are the decades of teachers who have taken the rough unrefined primary school boys and moulded them through an all-inclusive education experience to produce the young gentlemen of Kimberley Boys’ High who are so successful in the modern South Africa. I hope you enjoy browsing through the pages of our website.School LifeGrowing Beyond the Earth (GBE)Read More A DAY AT KIMBERLEY BOYS' HIGH SCHOOLADMISSIONACADEMICSPASTORALSPORTSCULTUREBOARDINGKHS STAFFNEWSLETTERKHS eLEARNING​^CONTACT US Corner of Dalham and Memorial Roads Kimberley 8300 Telephone Number: 053 8332684/5 Email Address: boyshigh@mweb.co.zaNAVIGATION Admission KHS Staff Academics Pastoral Sports Culture Boarding Gallery Downloads & Resources Newsletter Events© 2020 by MemsysOLD BOYS' UNION History Wall Of Remembrance Old Boys' News khsobu@kbhs.co.za ​bottom of page
