The first treatment can last anywhere between 1 1/2 to 2 hours + depending on how in depth we need to go. Included in an exam, assessment, treatment and information for aftercare. Thereafter, treatments can be from 20 min. to 90 depending on the individual. Pls be mindful that the treatment could include several modalities ie: acupuncture, laszer, tuina massage, cupping, ear seeds etc. How many treatments will I need? This depends on each person individually. Sometimes only one. Prevention and maintenance treatments are great regularly. Generally, if someone has been suffering from a chronic condition for years; it will take more than 5 treatments to help alleviate this deeper health challenge.
