Sriram, Ganesh Mohan and other teachings, the focus is on the therapeutic aspect of yoga: the movements are soft and fluent.All aspects of yoga (movement, breath, relaxation, meditation, mantra, reflection) are used and adapted with great accuracy to the individual needs, the skills and the everyday situation of the practitioners.With R. Sriram and especially in the Svastha Yoga therapy training at Dr.GÃ¼nter Niessen (yoga therapist and specialist in orthopedics) and Ganesh Mohan (yoga therapist and Ayurveda doctor) I got to know and love this flexible and creative approach to yoga.An individually adapted yoga practice always starts with one intention: Perhaps the aim is to better get through stressful medical treatment or get back on your feet faster after an illness.Another time we want to get rid of painful chronic tension.Or we want more strength or more mobility, in general or very special in a certain part of the body.In a demanding life situation, we may need more courage and serenity;And then again we find our life easy and pleasant and want to take the opportunity to combine again and again with the wide, open awareness, amazement and gratitude.And again and again we find that with the means of yoga and with sufficient persistence we can realize these (and many other) intentions that we have a treasure with it, a source of self -efficacy and trust in life.In recent years I have been able to accompany many people in individual lessons in this learning process.It is not always possible to resonate, ask the right questions, find the right pictures and exercises, understand a clear understanding and to arouse stable self -motivation.But it is the most beautiful task I know.Print Newsletter Texts by Michaela Literature and celebrate Imprint Data Protection
