Electric lighting electric lighting in order for the electric lighting to work normally, electric wires must be laid to lamps from electricity sources, various network devices and devices to protect the electric network from short circuits and to turn on and disconnecting lighting are installed in the necessary places, measures are taken to protectPeople from electric shock damage in case of random touch to lamps, devices and wires.The totality of lamps covering a building or room, an electric network laid to lamps from electricity sources, and the network devices and devices related to it are called the lighting installation of this building or room.Each lighting installation is quite clearly divided into two components - lighting and electrical.This small site is dedicated to the lighting part of the lighting installations.If you are interested in the requirements and norms for the illumination of warehouses or the lighting norms for sports facilities - follow the links - you will not find such specific information here.Which of the indicated two parts of lighting plants is more important is impossible to say, since each of them is unthinkable without the other.The correct and rational solution of the lighting unit creates good conditions for work - increases productivity, reduces the marriage of products, improves working conditions;Such an installation is economically and most rationally consumes electricity.But all these positive aspects of the well -made lighting part will turn out to be in vain if reliable and uninterrupted power supply of lamps with electricity is not provided, if the voltage is too low in light sources and the lamps will not give enough light, or too high, which will lead to a quick exit of the lamps from the lamps fromBuilding if frequent and large voltage fluctuations occur in the 'lighting network, causing a flash to the eyes that weigh the eyes, weary vision.It is equally important to make the lighting installation safe for working in the room and serving it.Since on a small site it is impossible to familiarize the reader with all the issues arising from the installation of the electrical part of lighting installations, we will give links to the work of third -party sites for more detailed familiarization with the device of electric lighting of industrial premises.Founded lighting terms and concepts may turn out to be insufficiently familiar to some readers.We believe that the reader is already familiar with the basic lighting information "Lighting technology is by no means a narrow discipline. It had a deep influence on numerous branches of knowledge. From the very source, science raised questions about the structure of the cosmos and the place of man in the Universe."- Lighting and lighting equipment.About household lamps, selection of lamps project Lamberry project Modern lamps Ceiling lamps like LSP Suspicious lamps Fortable lamps Lamps for general lighting Lamps of accenting lighting decorative lights and nightlights in the beginning
