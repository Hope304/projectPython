The motto of St. Joseph’s Convent, S. S.E.M.School, Pulluvazhy, inscribed within a shield is “Virtue Alone Ennobles”. The students are taught that what makes them noble is not only education, or the colour of the skin, or the race to which they belong. But its CHARACTER, which is formed by the practice of certain virtues, inculcating which, is a lifelong process. So students of St. Joseph’s Convent, have to work at becoming noble all their lives. They cannot take a holiday from work. Whatever they are, wherever they go, and in whatever they do, they must remember this important work of becoming noble through the practice of virtues. It is their prerogative to be kind, gentle, respectful, helpful, cheerful, hard working and enthusiastic at all times. The lily is symbolic of our Patron, St. Joseph. Like the lily, a student of St. Joseph’s Convent gives to other, the soft fragrance of goodness. The whiteness of the lily signifies purity of thought word and action...
