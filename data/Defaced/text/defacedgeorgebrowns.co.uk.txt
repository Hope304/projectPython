Mr Smith The personal touch and easy access to relevant staff to advise and solve minor issues is a rare thing these days. George Browns gives me the impression that the customer service and customer satisfaction is their number one priority Mr Alex I have always purchased larger items from Browns, chainsaws etc. So it was a natural choice for our new mower. They delivered the mower and gave a comprehensive demonstration, all along the way excellent.
