What guests say about their experience So ThankfulStaying at this place felts just like home. We had to move-in fast due to a plumbing issue in our home and Seema was a fantastic host. She provided support and guidance during our stay. The location is fantastic, full of convenience and luxury. Its peaceful and comfortable and the house is new and with all the amenities needed. A 5-star property with a 5-star host.Alex Happy Guest Perfect for a family!We stayed at the property near Stickney Lake and Paine Field. We are a family of 6 and we even welcomed our 5th child during our stay. We needed a temporary home while we sold our house in WA and waited to move out of state. Our rental term was about 5 months. Although this property was a bit smaller than our old home, the layout upstairs allowed for all persons to have a spacious and comfortable bedroom/living area. We didn’t feel cramped at all. The backyard was fully paved, which allowed our little ones to practice their bike riding. Was great for chalk art too! The location was extremely convenient for food, groceries, freeway, etc. Upon arrival, we found the home very clean and neatly styled. It was equipped with pretty much everything we needed for a long stay. The homeowner is an incredibly wonderful person who happily worked with us for our extended needs. She has just the right amount of care for her tenants without being over bearing. She was always extremely responsive to my inquiries and made sure we were as comfortable as possible. When a heat wave hit, she immediately dispatched someone to install air conditioning, for which we were extremely grateful. We had a lot going on during these 5 months, but the owner made our housing situation a smooth and stress free process. I HIGHLY recommend staying at any one of her properties!!Show less.Christina Navarrette Happy Guest Beautiful Home, 5 ⭐️ ServiceSeema was great to work with! Dealing with an unexpected catastrophe in our home, and having to vacate was extremely stressful. Being able to meet someone like Seema, and feel like we were in good hands was a comfort. She provided support and was flexible with our specific needs and accommodations. Would work with you again! Thanks so much.Sylvia Uilani Matayoshi Happy Guest Home away from home!After having massive water damage to our home, Seema came to our rescue. Staying at her property in Bothell for six months made the experience of being displaced less stressful. Our family had plenty of room and were able to settle in quickly. Seema is a very kind and generous host. I highly recommend staying at one of her properties!Mary F Happy Guest Submit Review Good Based on 3 reviews Steven July 21, 2021 Great time thanks To Seema would stay at her residence again anytime Claire July 7, 2021 This is a spacious and very clean place. The back yard is fenced in so our dogs could come in and out on their own. We loved hanging out in the living room where there were big entertainment chairs and a TV with all the streaming sites available. The kitchen was big and beautiful—all new accessories. Seema is a great host. She's very communicative and stayed in touch throughout our stay. We'll be back!
