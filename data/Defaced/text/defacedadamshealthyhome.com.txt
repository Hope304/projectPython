I was worried that we wouldn’t be able to get same day service on a holiday weekend, but Adam’s had a tech out to us by 10 am, and replaced the broken igniter right away with a part he had in his truck. We were so happy to find the same level of customer care and service from the Home business as we have gotten from Adam’s Pest Control. Stacy Anderson Brian was my service guy. called ahead to let me know when he would arrive, and was on time. Checked out our furnace and came to me with a complete report of what he found. Explained what needed to be fixed and the costs to make the repairs. He is a real pro. I feel great about the whole experience with Brian and the Adam’s people. Anonymous On time, highly competent and knowledgeable about the components of my system which were fairly complex. Very fair pricing and didn’t push me to buy stuff I didn’t need or “find” things that needed to be repaired. Will definitely call again Tom Jones Adams healthy home is the most professional and thorough HVAC service organization that I have used. The technician was both professional and knowledgeable. He took the time to review the results of his inspection. He explained the various options to deal with the issues that were discovered. Not only does he have a good grasp of HVAC, but is a very personable young man. In addition, he took the time to explain the various product lines of air cleaning systems that are available through Adams. He explained the cost breaks and opportunities for the variety of programs that Adams implements. Bob Ayotte We allowed Adam’s Healthy Home to come inspect our furnace yesterday. Technician Steve found a leaking gas regulator and strongly suggested getting it replaced. The gas company verified the leak and shut the gas off to avoid an explosion. We would like to take this time to thank Steve for his professionalism in this matter. He saved us from a serious situation.
