New Doctors starting in February 2024. Thank you to all our patients for your understanding and patience with the delays to appointments currently.

On behalf of everyone at Pioneer Medical Centre, we wish to thank Chantelle for being a wonderful part of our clinical team and wish her the very best for their future.Dr Stella Prescott is currently on maternity leave – she will return in 2024.Appointment informationPioneer Medical Centre is committed to provide care for our patients and plans are in progress to continue to provide care to our existing patient population. Currently we are experiencing a shortage of doctors. This means that currently there is a delay in getting an non-urgent appointment with a doctor at Pioneer Medical Centre. This shortage of GPs is occurring across Australia as a result of less doctors choosing general practice as a profession. Our staff will triage your appointment request and offer you the most appropriate appointment in a suitable timeframe, as guided by our GPs. We appreciate that this may not match your request but with limited appointments, staff are trying to ensure that urgent matters get priority appointments. Please treat our staff with respect as they work through your request.If you need a non urgent appointment with a doctor for scripts/referrals/preventative health, please contact us well in advance. Please be reassured that staff will triage your medical needs when you ring for an appointment. Urgent medical matters will be treated as a priority.Telehealth Consults Pioneer Medical Centre believes that the best patient care remains through face to face consults with your doctor. There may be circumstances when a phone consult is appropriate eg discussion of results, if you are unwell with a cold or isolated with Covid-19, or for follow up. Availability of phone consults remains the discretion of your doctor. Our staff can advise you whether you can book a phone consult so please discuss with them by ringing 83962522.Gaps will apply to phone consults – staff may request your payment details on booking and advise you on how to get your rebate.SA Health continue to recommend that all patients with coughs/cold have a Covid test immediately. Please stay well and observe the “stop the spread” campaign of social distancing, stay at home if unwell, good hand hygiene and cough etiquette.Government’s new MyMedicare Programme The Government announced in the 2023 Budget that they were implemented a new programme, MyMedicare, which is scheduled to commence 1st November 2023.The initiatives currently available through MyMedicare are limited and apply to only certain consults and selected eligible patients.There is no need for you to rush into registering with a practice at this time. Not registering will NOT impact your care through our practice. We already consider you to be enrolled as patients of our practice if you attend here, and that will not change. We will continue to monitor the development of this programme and provide more details as they become available. In the interim, doctors consulting from Pioneer Medical Centre are committed to the continuity of your healthcare. This is not reliant on Government measures such as MyMedicare.The introduction of MyMedicare does not change our fee policy or increase our fees at this time.Keeping our Patients safeAs Covid-19 and the flu continue to our communities, certain infection control steps remain in place to minimise cross infection from any upper respiratory infections.When you attend the practice for your medical appointment, IF YOU ARE UNWELL WITH COLD/FLU SYMPTOMS, RUNNY NOSE, SNEEZING OR A FEVER, DO NOT ENTER THE PRACTICE. Remain in your car and call us on 83962522 – staff will provide you with further instructions.It is highly recommended that patients continue to wear a mask when coming in to Pioneer Medical Centre but it is no longer mandatory. Wearing a mask will continue to protect you from cross infection as well as protecting other patients, clinic doctors and staff, ensuring our clinic remains a safe environment for vulnerable patients and minimizes the spread of infectious diseases in our community.Thank you for helping us with these important preventative measures.
