We have ordered the bhindi masala which was wonderful tasting. The chicken chettinad, malabar chicken curry, and a vegetarian dish that I have forgotten the name of. We will definitely be heading there again soon. Fantastic food! Joe Reffer One of the best Indian Food I have ever tasted in Essex. I typically order this Channa masala when I go out for Indian restaurants. Love the service of the Chef. Wilson. Sara Parlovsky Chicken was best I have tried in Indian restaurants. We got one Paneer dish which was nice and right amount of spice, the portion was big and the Naan was thin but my daughter liked it since it was crispy. Jenny Maze Grand Feast Unusual food combining the best of Indian cuisine. The very first bite provides a real explosion of flavours.
