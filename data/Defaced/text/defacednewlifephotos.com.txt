Tapping into our own natural resources of observation, imagination and more deeply connecting with our subjects is what allows us to extend our creative choices and discover our visual voice. I am thankful for the light. As we slow ourselves down, breathe in the moments with all our senses, we grow our “seeing” skills and our connection to the miracles – great and small – among us. I hope you’ll join me and New Life Photos in the journey to be encouraged, inspired and be present enough to let your creative flow expand.
