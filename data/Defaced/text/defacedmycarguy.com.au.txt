What People Say About Us Dave is a fantastic man to work with. He goes above and beyond to make the whole process a smooth one. This is the second time I have used Dave, highly recommended. Katy Reeve Dave was friendly, professional, knowledgeable and brilliant to work with. He found us what we wanted, in quick time, at a good price. He also helped us sell our old car. If you are looking for a new car, I can not recommend him more highly. Andrew Schwartz Dave from "My Car Guy" was excellent, found the ute I wanted very quickly despite shortages due to covid, negotiated the price and delivered on time. I highly recommend Dave and My Car Guy! Gerard Ryan David has provided me with professional and honest advice. He replied quickly to all my queries whether by phone or email. He personally delivered my car understanding my work situation. I will definitely use his services in future and have already recommended him to my friends. Howaida Shafik Fantastic service. Dave was able to find the car I was after with the specs on the car I required and with in the budget. Highly Recommended. Dave is now our Car Guy! Stephen Georgiou Dave was amazing to deal with, super fast, efficient and punctual. Everything he promised, he delivered. I can highly recommend Dave and will be using him again in the future. Jack Cox My Car Guy was extremely efficient and a great help. I'd negotiated as best I could in the showroom but Dave got me a great deal on a new Ranger within days and an offer that was far better than I'd managed on my own. I'd recommend anyone looking for a new car to give My Car Guy a call.
