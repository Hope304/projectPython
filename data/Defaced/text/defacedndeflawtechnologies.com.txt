Read More NDT CALIBRATION REFERENCE STANDARDS REFERENCE STANDARDS What are standards? Standards are documented agreements containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines, or definitions of characteristics, in order to ensure that materials, products, processes, and services are fit for their purpose. Read More ECT EDDY CURRENT STANDARDS (Surface) EDDY CURRENT TESTING STANDARDS (Surface) The product is passed through or adjacent to an electrical test coil, which has been excited by an alternating current. This induces a flow of eddy currents around the test material or in the case of a sector coil, in the area under the coil. Read More EDDY CURRENT TUBE STANDARDS-ECT EDDY CURRENT TUBE STANDARDS Eddy current inspection is often used to detect corrosion, erosion, cracking and other changes in tubing. Heat exchangers and steam generators, which are used in power plants, have thousands of tubes that must be prevented from leaking. Read More IMPORTANCE OF FLAT BOTTOM HOLES (FBH) and SIDE DRILLED HOLE (SDH) IMPORTANCE OF FLAT BOTTOM HOLES (FBH) and SIDE DRILLED HOLE (SDH) Flat-bottom-hole reference blocks have been used as defect artifact standards in nondestructive testing for many years. Hole making process can be employ by both conventional machining (drilling) or non-conventional machining (EDM). Read More VACCUM BOX INSPECTION KIT VACCUM BOX INSPECTION KIT Vacuum box testing is a non-destructive examination (NDE/NDT) used for locating welding leaks. A vacuum box and a compressor create a high or low-pressure vacuum and a detergent solution is applied to the test area. The detergent bubbles help to identify the leaks within the created pressure envelope.

Read More IMPORTANCE OF CALIBRATION AND TRACEABILITY IMPORTANCE OF CALIBRATION AND TRACEABILITY What is calibration? Calibration is a comparison between a known measurement (the standard) and the measurement using your instrument. Typically, the accuracy of the standard should be ten times the accuracy of the measuring device being tested. However, an accuracy ratio of 3:1 is acceptable by most standards organizations. Read More IMPORTANCE OF REPLICA SAMPLES IMPORTANCE OF REPLICA SAMPLES BASIC PRINCIPLE OF REPLICA: Non-destructive metallography of surfaces makes it possible to analyses a material microstructure and a surface condition as well as various surface damages occurring due to overloading or improper tribological circumstances. Machine or tool parts inspected are not damaged during the surface preparation. Read More HIGH TEMPERATURE HYDROGEN CRACK HIGH TEMPERATURE HYDROGEN CRACK INTRODUCTION: High temperature hydrogen crack (HTHC), also called hot hydrogen crack, is a problem which concerns steels operating at elevated temperatures (typically above 400°C) in hydrogen environments, in refinery, petrochemical and other chemical facilities and, possibly, high pressure steam boilers. Read More NDT REFERENCE STANDARD FOR BEARING INDUSTRIES NDT REFERENCE STANDARD BEARING INDUSTRIES A bearing is a mechanical unit that provides a mobile link between two parts that rotate in relation to one another. Its function is to permit relative rotation of these parts, under load, with accuracy and minimum friction. Read More STRESS CORROSION CRACK STRESS CORROSION CRACK The mechanism of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) involves a very complicated sequence of corrosion and fracture. It has been shown that, for some materials, fine pitting is needed to start the activity. Further progress is then a process alternating between corrosion and mechanical cracking until the material fails completely. Read More OUR TUBE STANDARDS FOR ECT RFT NFT MFL IRIS NFA OUR TUBE STANDARDS FOR-ECT, RFT, NFT, MFL, IRIS, NFA Eddy Current Testing (ECT) works on the principle of electromagnetic induction. In ECT a probe is excited with sinusoidal alternating current to induce eddy current in an electrically conducting material such as stainless steel, aluminum etc. Read More ECT TUBE STANDARDS (FIN TUBES) FIN TUBES We are manufacturing fin tubes as per the standard of ASME SEC VIII and API 661 requirement with flaw for Non Destructive Testing. The flawed fin tubes are used to set the Non Destructive Testing equipment prior to work on the examination.
