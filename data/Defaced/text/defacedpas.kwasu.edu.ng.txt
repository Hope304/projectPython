The faculty is presently made up of nine (9) departments with over 6,000 regular students and offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in eleven (11) programmes that are all fully accredited by the National University Commission. At its inception, Prof. Deboye Kolawole served as the foundation provost of the College of Pure and Applied Sciences. Other past provosts of the College include Prof. Silas Dada, Prof. Adebayo Olaniyi Aina and Prof. Adebayo A. Oladimeji. The current Dean is Emmanuel Oladipo Ajani, a professor of Biochemistry. Our staff conducts research comparable to the standard obtainable internationally and our research is focused on solving global environmental, industrial and nutritional challenges, understanding diseases and developing new drugs, advancing technologies, analysing data and much more. Our staff strength includes over one hundred (100) academic staff and thirty-one (31) technical staff.

Some of the achievements of the faculty include: Faculty Lecture On 21st March 2021, the faculty held the maiden edition of the annual Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences lecture series. The faculty lecture was conceived to cultivate a stronger academic atmosphere at Kwara State University by showcasing the scholarly activities of renowned academics.

The lecture series showcases and promotes excellence in science and provides rich opportunities for students, faculty staff and the public to listen to internationally renowned scholars as they address important issues in science. The lecture topics are carefully selected to address scientific issues of the day and provide the right forum to discuss advancement in science. In 2022, the lecture was renamed “Professor Musbau Akanji, Annual Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences Lecture” and an endowment programme was thereafter instituted to ensure that the lecture is held in perpetuity. Past guest lecturers are Professor Abel Idowu Olayinka (former Vice-Chancellor, University of Ibadan) who gave a lecture on “New Frontiers in 3D Geological Mapping and Implications for Solid Mineral Development in Nigeria”. Professor Musbau Akanji, FAS (a two times Vice-Chancellor) delivered the 2022 Annual Lecture that was titled “Role of Science, Technology and Innovation in National Development: Any Hope for Nigeria in This 21st Century?” The 2023 Annual lecture was titled “Leveraging on participative global treaties and strategies – imperatives for pollution control and sustainable development” and was delivered by distinguished Professor Babajide I Alo FAS, from University of Lagos.
