Call us today for an estimate! OUR FULL LIST OF SERVICECS What To Expect During A Cleaning & Inspection The cleaning and inspection generally starts inside the home or from the roof. Using a variety of tools the flue will be brushed using rotating steel brushes which scrape the edges and knock loose any buildup or creosote. Most objects or buildup found in the flue are flammable and can cause a serious safety hazard. After running the brushes they will clean any residual dust or debris in the firebox. At this point once everything is cleaned they will perform an inspection. The technician will inspect the firebox or stove to ensure everything is properly sealed and that the dampener is functional. For wood burning fireplaces they will look at the refractory panels to ensure there is no where for heat to escape. After this they will get on top of the home and inspect the chimney and chimney cap. Once they’ve verified that water or other objects aren’t entering the chimney they will perform a visual inspection down the entire flue to check for cracks or shifting in the liner. A comprehensive report is provided to the customer, if anything is found to violate local building codes or regulations. An estimate will also be provided detailing what works needs to be done to bring it up to code and what the estimated cost would be.

Our latest cleaning tools are capable enough of reaching areas that you usually can’t. Some common reasons your chimney might not pass inspection include: 5 Cracked or Damaged Refractory Panels Refractory panels act as an insulator for the fire. They seal in and direct heat or smoke so it can be properly ventilated up the chimney and out of the home. 5 Missing Chimney Cap A chimney cap is the hat your fireplace wears. It acts as a shield to prevent animals, debris, or water from entering the chimney. Water can deteriorate the mortar or masonry work of your chimney. Debris like birds nests, or branches from a nearby tree can result in a fire hazard. 5 Shifted Or Cracked Flue Or Liner All chimneys have some type of liner or flue that is what directs the heat through the chimney. In Terracotta liners it’s not uncommon to see cracks or shifting.
