Guided by long-standing traditions and the love for our family's wine, we from Pirgovo Winery cultivate with grace and passion every grape to create a wine of perfect color, crystal clearness, characteristic aroma and specific and pronounced flavor. To attain the perfect bottle of wine, first of all quality grape is required. That's why we produce our wine from organic vineyards grown in compliance with all European standards for organic production. The rock within which the wine cellar is located and the tunnel with stone lining, create the perfect conditions for wine maturation. In each glass of wine we add a drop of love.
