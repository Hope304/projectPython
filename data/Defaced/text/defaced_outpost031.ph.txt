Book your game Whar Our Clients Say Reviews of our Escape Room Game ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 5/5 John Anthony Tindoc The Best Escape Room in the CountryI am not a newcomer to escape rooms. I have played most of the rooms in Manila Breakouts and I have tried Mystery Manila escape rooms as well. The common theme is usually locks&keys and codes. The best so far has been Breakout‚Äôs Hush room‚Äîwhich had excellent live performance but less of the puzzles. And now here comes Outpost031 with with their Arctic Horror Escape Room. I didn‚Äôt expect too much at the start. But Im very gland I was wrong. This is possibly the best escape room I‚Äôve played in. It‚Äôs more than locks, key, and codes. The setting is immersive. And unlike other escape rooms which banks on distractions for making clues difficult, or a short limited 45 minutes, and approximately P500-P800 per head ‚Äî this local escape room costs much less, allows 80 minutes and uses more numerous interesting and amazing mechanisms (rather than a whole lot of boring distractions). Overall, I think this is the best escape room in the country ‚Äî and its in Dumaguete. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 5/5 Ryland Sharp This is just what Dumaguete needed!They have so many games to choose from and their escape room is the best I have seen so far. The owners and staff are really friendly; it's easy to see that they really care for Outpost031. Also the coffee they have for sale is of very high quality. I reccomend having one before you jump into VR. üëå Keep up the great work guys! ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 5/5 Tim Latimer The exceptional experienceGreat set up, everything was very professionally done. Definitely can recommend it. I've been to escape rooms in Cebu and Manila and this beats them hands down. You can tell that a lot of care has gone into making the experience exceptional. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 5/5 Kim Chawdhury 10/10!!Highly recommended! Best experience I've had in forever! You can see that a lot of love went into designing this experience. If you're looking for something to do this Halloween, and want a fresh experience with your friends, you should definitely try Outpost031's escape room!
