Shared hosting is a type of web hosting service where multiple websites are hosted on a single server, sharing its resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage space. How many websites can I host on a shared hosting plan? The number of websites that can be hosted on a shared hosting plan depends on the plan you choose. At Alihost, shared hosting plans start from 2 website per hosting plan to unlimited website. Based on your needs, find your perfect plan. Is shared hosting suitable for high-traffic websites? Shared hosting may not be suitable for high-traffic websites as the resources are shared among multiple websites. If your website receives a lot of traffic, it may cause the server to slow down and affect other websites hosted on the same server. In this case, we offer a range of affordable and fast VPS servers that aligns your need. Can I upgrade my shared hosting plan to a VPS or dedicated server later on? Yes, we at Alihost allow you to upgrade your shared hosting plan to a VPS or dedicated server later on as your website grows and requires more resources. What security measures are in place to protect my website. We at Alihost typically implement security measures such as firewalls, malware scanning, and regular backups to protect websites. However, it’s important to also implement your own security measures such as using strong passwords and keeping your website software up to date.
