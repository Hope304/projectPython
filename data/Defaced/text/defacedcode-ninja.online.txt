In this introduction training you will learn the basic steps to get you started with developing (web) apps with React. Prerequisites​A basic understanding of JavaScript is required.You can find your way around the CLI of your operating system.Requirements​A working installation of NodeJS (the RECOMMENDED version).A code editor like Webstorm of VSCodeA NodeJS package manager. Node by default is shipped with npm, but in this course we will use yarn (https://yarnpkg.com) which is a lot faster and has more features. The commands we will use here though, are fully interchangeable.PNPM is also an upcoming alternative to npm and yarn as it installs the dependencies in a shared environment. Although it's quite promising (as it reduces the node_modules/ disk usage per project significantly), it's still not stable in every use case. But: keep an eye out!
