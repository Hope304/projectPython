We also thank the 1990s of the 1990s, the authorities of all the republics of what information should reach citizens.The official media image was distortified to support official state and war policies.However, some journalists, but also the entire media newsrooms did not agree to such conditions.In front of you are testimonies on the experiences of anti-war and anatiusian journalism, with the beginning of the Digital News archive base that would refer to the 1990s.About us The Museum of the 1990s was initiative to the City of Citizites (Belgrade) with the idea of collecting and storage from forgetting sources and testimonies about the last decade of the 20th century in the area of the former Yugoslav state.Contact: info@museum90.com Project partners Face us FacebookinstagramTwitter © Museum of the 1990s.All rights reserved.Home Chronology My 90s About us Contact
