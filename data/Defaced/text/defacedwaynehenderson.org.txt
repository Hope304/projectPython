Our priority is funding scholarships. We are a non-profit and have a very small production committee, every year we rely on a large number of wonderful volunteers the weekend of the festival. We are extremely frugal with overhead expenses so we can direct as much money as possible toward scholarships. We have awarded $418,950 in scholarships over the years. You can donate by credit card or check. Donate Now Links & News Wayne's Performances Keep up with Wayne in concert. All Those Years Explore 24 Years of Festival Logos, Shirt by Shirt.
