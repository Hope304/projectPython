The set includes two clasp cake molds, one with a diameter of 24 cm and the other with a diameter of 28 cm. Crafted from aluminum, these molds ensure even baking and easy cake release. Set Includes: Clasp Cake Mold (24 cm) Clasp Cake Mold (28 cm) Material: Aluminum Recommended Baking Techniques:When baking cakes, sometimes we can accidentally add a bit too much sugar to make it more delicious. This is when we find ourselves asking why the cake stuck to the mold. If we use too much sugar and add acidic ingredients like lemon, the cake can stick to the mold and become difficult to remove.To ensure easy cake release, prepare the cake batter according to these criteria and follow the recommended baking times in the recipe. For instance, if a recipe calls for 180°C for 40 minutes, stick to it. Additionally, using parchment paper can extend the lifespan of your baked goods. The baking temperature for Circle cake molds should be 180°C. Recommended Cleaning Methods:Products washed in a dishwasher undergo sudden temperature changes, so products recommended for hand washing should not be put in the dishwasher. This is because modern dishwashing tablets can cause excessive wear on products, leading to damage.It's advised to wash the Circle cake mold with a soft sponge by hand. The mold's clasps are rust-free. Add to cart office furniture Add to wishlist Compare Quick view Metuzzi – Lichi Indoor Chair $169.99 Material: wood, fabric. Suitable for: Indoor use.
