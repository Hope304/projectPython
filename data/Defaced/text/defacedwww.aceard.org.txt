Green School Project Donate Now The West Africa’s coastline was reputed for its rich mangroves plantation which protected the coastline aganist erosion; provided a safe haven for the breeding of fishes and fingerlings and generally served as a natural embankment against ocean surges. The greatest threat to the mangrove ecosystem is the exotic invasive Nypa palm, which displaces the mangrove stands thereby establishing itself in a mono-specific manner. The incursion of Nypa palm has taken its toll on the coastal vegetation of Nigeria especially the Niger Delta region.We are soliciting your donation to help our works in restoring the degraded mangroves in West Africa coastline. Each donation you made, ACEARD will issue you with receipt and a certificate indicating how many mangroves your donation has helped to plant.
