Computer programming promotes logical thinking, Learning to code helps a students' creativity, When students learn to code they develop persistence, Coding helps to develop resilience . How difficult is coding? Coding isn't hard, it just requires more time and practice than you might expect. To be a competent coder, you need to learn how to produce products, not just write code. ... Most coding training doesn't cover these things, so it's no wonder people get frustrated and give up. How do I figure out what to learn ? The most important thing is that you want to learn something that interests you, because once you start learning, you’ll be with this topic for a while. Choosing something just because it’s popular or what others are doing isn’t the way to go because if you don’t have a true interest in it, you’ll lose the motivation to learn! Spend some time seriously looking into the different tech career paths before choosing one. Should I learn skills in several areas, or focus on one Thing in particilar ? Personally, I’d say choose a path and stick to it! Learning too many things at once will slow you down. What the fastest way/shortcuts to learn to code ? To be a good programmer, there are no shortcuts. That is not the right way to think about it :) Instead, you should take time mastering the fundamentals. This will help you in the long run.Learning to code isn’t something that can be rushed. It’s exactly the same as learning a new language. It takes time to master, but it’ll be worth it once you do.  0+ Users  0+ Cities  0+ Transactions  0+ Groups Feedback Binary Systems Useful Links Home About, Services Blogs, Gallery Career Contact Our Services Web Design Web Development Product Management Marketing Graphic Design Contact Us HEAD OFFICE : Udyog Vihar,Phase 4, Gurgaon DATA CENTER : First Floor, Garima Arcade, Gwalior Phone: +91 9009054508 [email protected] © Copyright Binary Systems.
