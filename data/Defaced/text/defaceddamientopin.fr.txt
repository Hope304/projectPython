Opens Linkedin page I'm Damien, I am a freelance graphic designer in Cambodia from where I help businesses developing their brand identity. Siem Reap has been my home since 2016. Most of my clients are local connections from word to mouth but I also work internationally. I've done several projects across Cambodia for companies located in Phnom Penh, Kampot or Mondolkiri. I worked previously as a graphic designer in Paris (France) and Sydney (Australia). Skills I speak french natively and english fluently. My area of expertise goes from graphic design to 3D concept and mockup. I also do packaging design, web design and development (Custom code to a certain degree or with Oxygen builder), video animation and video montage. Visual identity Having a professional looking logo is the first step towards developing a good branding/visual identity for any type of business. Here you will find some of the best logos I’ve made along the way. Clients Siem Reap being mostly a touristic destination I had the opportunity to apply my graphic design skills for various types of clients : Hotels, Eco Resorts and Restaurants (menu, brochure, flyer, business card, compendium, banner, paper work, 3D illustration), local food businesses (packaging, stickers, street sign, website), real estate (3D simulation, photo retouching) and personal projects (video editing, 3D animation). International As a graphic designer I can also work remotely. I have worked for several french clients in France and also for some other clients based in Australia. We arrange few videos calls along the process and that’s it, easy peazy !
