| -O- |ENGLISH Home pageHome pageLife is one, death is once.It was the motto of Georgi Panayotov (among relatives, colleagues and friends also known as Goggi, Joro, Arioch, Yori, Alastis, Spirit and many others).Unfortunately, life for Joro turned out to be too short and he left us too early - April 12, 2010 :-( This website was created by him years ago, with Joro constantly developing it as content and design. Now, in his memory, we - the family, friends and colleagues, we decided to keep the website in its original form, allowing ourselves only to complement the content with more Joro works, as well as with a special section of memories in which anyone who wants to share photos, memories, events, eventsStories, etc. Related to Joro. If you have suggestions or something to share, please contact the current administrator of the site master.gamgee@gmail.com below is Joro's last introstion to his website Hello! Well, this page (the starting page (the start) I am most disliked, but I can't skip her. It should follow some greeting, or who knows what to fill a few lines, etc.In this, I would become a writer. In fact, the only thing I want to emphasize from here are several sites of my friends.I don't have a separate section with references - I had earlier, but I considered it unnecessary - so I will write them here.If a person wants to find something so much, he will go to a search engine, right.However, these few sites are not the ones that will get you from time to time.They probably don't even overlap your interests, but I urge you to cast one eye on them.Armenellos - This is the first of its kind Tolkien university.Endorion - Definitely the richest and full site dedicated to J.Tolkien in Bulgaria.Melnobone - finally, I modestly insert this creation of mine, dedicated to the English -fiction writer Michael Murkok (unfortunately not particularly popular in our country).<Back |^ up Â© Georgi Panayotov - 1999 - 2024
