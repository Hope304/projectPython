Ang Domain name at web hosting ay kailangan i-renew regularly upang mapanatili ang ownership ng website address sa’yo at ma-ensure na palaging accessible ito sa internet. Hindi ako naka-renew, ano ang mangyayari sa website ko?Website Downtime: Your website will become inaccessible to visitors, leading to a loss of traffic and potential customers. Loss of Domain Ownership: Your domain name may become available for others to purchase, resulting in losing your unique website address. Loss of Data: Your hosting provider may delete your website’s data, including files, databases, and email accounts, which can be difficult or impossible to recover. Reputation Impact: Your online presence and brand reputation may be negatively affected due to the website being down or the domain being taken over by someone else. It’s essential to renew your website to avoid these issues and maintain a consistent online presence. Unable to find the answer to your question? You can send us a message here.
