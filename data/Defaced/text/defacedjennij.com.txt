ABOUT ME | JenniJ top of pageABOUT MECONTACTMoreUse tab to navigate through the menu items.Jen KrippelEVENTS MANAGERRESUMEPROJECTSWho am I?Organizer. Dog mom. Admirer of all things sparkly (and sparkling). Sports fan. Traveler. Water baby. Wine lover. Shopaholic. Design enthusiast.​I'm sure there are many additional words I could use to describe myself, but you get the gist. My world is filled with more than I could ever have imagined. It's taken me many years to appreciate the simple things in life and to be able to stand back and just enjoy the ride. Be kind. Be humble. Be yourself. Take time to laugh, time to cry, and time to dance - or in my case, twirl!! Whatever you do - just enjoy the moment.© 2023 by JenniJ Ltd. Call814-867-3376Writeadmin@JenniJ.comFollowbottom of page
