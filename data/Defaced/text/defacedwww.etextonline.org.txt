View More Details of Coronavirus explained × TITLE: Coronavirus explained DATE: Mar-19-2020 INFORMATION: By Tuesday, the novel coronavirus outbreak in the United States had grown to at least 760 cases, with clusters in New York, Washington state and California, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking reports and confirming them with local health departments. The number of cases in the U.S. and worldwide is the subject of some debate, as testing has been rolled out unevenly and the criteria for diagnosis (through clinical means or a lab test) has varied from country-to-country. Despite the growing number of lab-confirmed cases in the U.S., the figures pale in comparison, for instance, to the seasonal flu, which kills an estimated 12,000 to 61,000 people per year and affects between 9 million and 45 million people in the country alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Phelps is now self-quarantined at home. Until Tuesday, she couldn't get in touch with her mother at all. The phone lines at Life Care were busy, and many families nervously emailed each other when they couldn't get through to the nursing home. "All the families are really worried, not knowing if our loved ones are even alive, if they have the virus," Phelps told ABC News via Skype. MORE: Americans hoarding hand sanitizer, face masks and oat milk amid coronavirus fears Some of the families were trying to reach nursing home residents who have dementia, are bedridden or who have had strokes that affect their speaking ability, meaning they aren't able to talk over the phone. Getting in touch with Life Care was their only option. "None of us can get through, and nobody's allowed in there, so we're just shut out," said Phelps, who's also worried about her own health after she had cancer last year. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions face a greater risk of complications from COVID-19.

Household maintenance masks sales were similarly up 262% in that same period. Hand sanitizer sales spiked 73%, though Nielsen predicts that the demand for sanitizer hasn't even begun to peak. Sales of thermometers were up by 47%, and aerosol disinfectant purchases climbed 32%.

Shelf-stable pantry items are moving briskly, with oat milk sales increasing more than 300% in the one-week period ending Feb. 22. Fruit snacks, pet medicine and dried beans rose about 10%, as sales of first-aid kits, supplements and bottled water also rising during that span.

A sign on a shelf at a QFC grocery store in Kirkland, Wash., advises shoppers, March 3, 2020, that all hand sanitizer products are sold out.Ted S. Warren/AP High consumer demand for face masks and hand sanitizer has rattled health officials, who've warned that a run on those products outbreak may be misguided. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't currently recommend for healthy people to wear a mask to protect against coronavirus. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams implored the public to stop buying masks in a tweet Saturday, writing they are "NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!" MORE: Facebook cracking down on ads that guarantee coronavirus cure Medical professionals and the CDC still recommend old-fashioned hand washing with soap and water over hand sanitizers. If soap and water aren't readily available, then the CDC recommends opting for an alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. "We are used to the convenience of the hand sanitizer, which we can carry around with us," Dr. William Schaffner, the medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told ABC News. "They are wonderful, but if you happen to run out, go to a sink," he added. "Certainly do that when you get home. When you get home, hang up your coat and go directly to sink." As for the run on supplies, Schaffner said he isn't worried. "I think those supplies will be fairly rapidly restored," he said. "The companies say they are working hard and they will be able to supply the demand."

New York State has recorded 83,712 diagnoses and 1,941 deaths, both the highest among US States and territories, read the update. Stay-at-home order SEE ALSO: Cuba-US relations backslide five years after landmark thaw US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will not issue a national stay-at-home order even as coronavirus cases are still surging in the country. Trump told reporters at a White House Coronavirus Task Force news briefing that he does not intend to do so because different states have different levels of Covid-19 cases. "You have to look -- you have to give a little flexibility. If you have a state in the Midwest, or if Alaska for example doesn't have a problem, it's awfully tough to say close it down. We have to have a little bit of flexibility," Trump said at the briefing.

This is big, as this is the first time we, scientists, have seen the data. Things are looking good. Well, not just good, they are looking great. This trial was as clean as it can get. There is nothing (big) we didn't expect. Efficacy. • We see benefit starting 14 days after the first dose (see Figure). This makes sense because it takes about 2 weeks for the immune system to make sufficient antibody protection after vaccination. • After the first dose, efficacy was 52%. This is a fantastic for a single dose. • After your second dose (3 weeks later), efficacy is 95%. We are confident that efficacy ranges from 90-98%. • Efficacy doesn’t meaningfully differ by age, race/ethnicity, or comorbidity. Adverse events. • Overall, the Pfizer vaccination gives more adverse events than the flu vaccination but less than the shingles vaccine. • The most common solicited adverse reaction (i.e. what we were expecting) were mild to moderate: injection site reactions (84.1%), fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle pain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%), fever (14.2%) • The chance of getting a severe adverse event was low (0.5%). A severe event is more likely in the second dose than the first and were less frequent among older adults compared to younger participants. • An unsolicited (i.e. not expected) adverse event that came up more in the vaccine group was swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). 64 people in the vaccine group compared to 6 people in the placebo group. This could be related to the vaccine. • There were 4 people in the vaccine group that got Bell’s palsy (compared to 0 in the placebo group). These cases occurred at 3, 9, 37, and 48 days after vaccination. This isn’t much of a concern because it reflects the same rate of Bell’s palsy in the general population. Something to keep an eye on • 6 people died during the trial (4 in placebo; 2 in vaccine group). Deaths were NOT related to the vaccine. Mostly related to heart attacks. There are a few unknowns. From this study, we do not know… • Duration of protection • Effectiveness against transmission • Effectiveness or safety among certain high-risk populations, such as children less than 16 years of age, pregnant and lactating individuals, and immunocompromised individuals. There were just not enough people in the study to make meaningful conclusions. This likely means that the FDA will not approve emergency use for these populations. We will know more on Thursday. • Benefits of individuals with prior COVID19 infection. But, given there is documented reinfection, the FDA stated that previously infected people could benefit from vaccination. Translation: This vaccine will likely be approved on Thursday. Which, by the way, will be streaming live. An event that will likely go down in history, albeit a bit boring, scientific, and long.
