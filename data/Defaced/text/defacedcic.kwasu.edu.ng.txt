To be the foremost in expanding the frontier of knowledge in Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry and the most innovative in research, teaching and community development ii. To be the fulcrum of a knowledge-driven society, building human competencies. Brief History Of The Department Department of Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry was one of the foundational departments of the university at its take-off in 2009. The Department runs two programmes (B.Sc. Chemistry and B.Sc. Industrial Chemistry). Both programmes were approved at the take-off of the university in 2009. However, the B.Sc. (Chemistry) programme was delayed till 2012 to recruit adequate and capable faculty members. The duration for the two programmes is 8 semesters (4 academic sessions) for the UTME candidates and 6 semesters (3 academic sessions) for the Direct Entry candidates. In 2012, the B.Sc. The Industrial Chemistry programme had its maiden accreditation exercise and was granted full accreditation status. The programme was reaccredited in 2017 and got full accreditation status. The B.Sc. The chemistry programme was first accredited in 2016 and got an interim accreditation status. The reaccreditation exercise came up in 2018, and the programme got full accreditation status. The reaccreditation exercise of B.Sc. The Industrial Chemistry programme came up in November 2022, and it was a huge success. Expectedly, that of B.Sc. Chemistry programme will come up later in 2023. In 2019, the National Universities Commission (NUC) approved the commencement of postgraduate programmes comprising Postgraduate Diploma in Chemistry/Industrial Chemistry, Master (M.Sc.) in Chemistry/Industrial Chemistry and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Chemistry/Industrial Chemistry.
