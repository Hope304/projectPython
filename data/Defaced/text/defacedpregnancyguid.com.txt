More thought of marriage comes in the mind of the girl.The boy realizes that he is in his own house. He has not gone anywhereWhile the girl keeps thinking about it. One is that she has to leave his parents' house.The second thought that worries a girl is not knowing who she will marry.In whose house will she get married, what will her husband be like? How will the father and mother in-laws be? In the third place, the thought that worries the girl the most.That is what will happen on the wedding night. What is pregnancy, how is pregnancy and how are babies born? We will answer all these questions in our next article.But today our topic is for these couples. Those who are married and trying to conceive.We are going to tell you and share with you how you can increase your chances of getting pregnant.How To Increase Your Chances Of Getting Pregnant.There are two things you need to know to get pregnant.1. What Role Does Your Menstrual Cycle Play In Getting Pregnant?2. What Role Does Your Ovulation Play In Getting Pregnant?Pay Attention To Your Menstrual Cycle To Get Pregnant.A woman who wants to get pregnant needs to monitor her menstrual cycle.Whether her period comes in the same number of days every month is considered regular. A normal menstrual cycle ranges from 21 days to 35 days.If your menstrual cycle is less than 19 days and more than 35 days. So your period is irregular.According to experts, a woman can best estimate her ovulation day then. When she knows the days of her menstrual cycle.According to experts, a woman's egg is fertilized only for 12 to 24 hours, while a man's sperm can survive in a woman's body for up to five days.Monitor Ovulation.Women with regular cycles ovulate about two weeks before their next period.Ovulation is difficult to predict in women with irregular cycles, but it usually occurs 12 to 16 days before the start of their next period.If your menstrual cycle is heavy and sometimes short.The days and times of your ovulation also change as the days of your menstrual cycle get shorter or longerThis change means it's best to monitor ovulation to find out when you're most likely to get pregnant.There are several ovulation tracking methods that women can use to help determine their most fertile days each month.How To Track Ovulation With Home Ovulation Test Kit (OTK)Kits sold at pharmacies or medical stores test urine for luteinizing hormone (LH).Luteinizing hormone is a hormone produced in the female body. The level of which increases every month during ovulation and causes the egg to be released from the ovary.According to experts, if your ovulation test is positive.After the ovulation test comes back positive, you meet your husband or partner.So your chances of getting pregnant increase considerably.How To Get Pregnant After PeriodsAnother way to predict ovulation is to track your discharge, in which a woman regularly checks both the amount and appearance of her discharge.According to experts and my own experience, just before ovulation, when a woman is most fertile, the amount of discharge increases, and it becomes thinner, clearer and more slippery.When the discharge becomes more slippery, it can help the sperm reach the egg.One survey found that women who regularly checked their discharge were 2.3 times more likely to conceive within a six-month period.How To Track Ovulation With Basal Body TemperatureA good way to monitor ovulation in most cases is by taking a core temperature.To check for ovulation, check your temperature before you get out of bed, at the same time every morning, and keep a chart or record of each day's reading.Normally, your average body temperature is between 97 and 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit (36.1 and 36.4 degrees Celsius).When you are ovulating or near ovulation, your body temperature rises slightly.A woman's core body temperature on ovulation days averages between 97.6 and 98.6 Fahrenheit (36.4 and 37 C).After ovulation, the egg will remain fertile for about 12 to 24 hours.Because your basal temperature will vary slightly, it's important to use a digital thermometer or a special basal thermometer.Does Getting Older Make A Difference In Getting Pregnant?As women age, Their fertility decreases.This is due to age-related changes in the ovaries that lead to a decrease in the quantity and quality of her eggs.With increasing age, the risk of certain health problems also increases, such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis and blockage of the fallopian tubes, which can lead to loss of fertility.Experts say that women's fertility gradually declines starting in their 30s.After the age of 37, there is a significant decline in fertility and after the age of 40, there is a sharp decline. Getting older means it may take longer to get pregnant.How To Get Pregnant With PCOS And Irregular PeriodsCan Taking Vitamins Help You Get Pregnant?Experts say that women who are trying to conceive should start taking vitamins before they get pregnant. That way, a woman can find something more acceptable to her system and stick with it during pregnancy.Experts also say that taking a daily multivitamin increases the chances of getting pregnant fast.Take folic acid 400 micrograms daily for a month or two before trying.Vitamin E is very good for our hair and skin, as well as for the development of our uterus and baby's organs. You can also use vitamin BThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has emphasized women.that they take 400 mcg of folic acid daily for at least one month before becoming pregnant,To help prevent birth defects.It is a good idea to begin folic acid supplementation as the neural tube develops in the brain and spinal cord three to four weeks after conception.Before many women even realize they are expecting. It is best to consult your doctor before taking any medicine and vitamins.What Is The Best Time To Get Pregnant?If you meet your partner during the days of ovulation, you are more likely to get pregnant.You need to know your menstrual cycle to check and determine the day of ovulation.If you have a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation usually occurs 14 days before your next period. This means you will ovulate on the 14thIt can be difficult to know when you are ovulating, so you will need an ovulation test.If you don't have an ovulation test kit available or don't want to test.So another easy way is to meet your partner from time to time. Meeting every second or third day increases and can increase the chances of getting pregnant.Maintain a healthy weight to get pregnant FastToo much and too Low weight is not good for both men and women.Being overweight or underweight means you are less likely to get pregnant.Also, men with a normal weight produce better quality sperm.Measure your body mass index (BMI). If your BMI is between 20 and 25, you are at a healthy weight.If your BMI is over 30, it can affect your ability to get pregnant.If you're overweight, losing 5 percent of your body weight can improve your fertility.Exercise to get pregnant, but not too much.Regular moderate exercise is good for your body and mind.And can help you get pregnantAvoid very vigorous exercise as it can reduce your fertility.For example, Womens and Girls athletes who participate in marathons, weightlifting, heavy exercise and heavy championships sometimes stop menstruating.Heavy exercise doesn't just stop your period. It can also affect your uterus and eggs.Due to which it can become a problem to get pregnant early.Read MoreWhat Is Ovulation Period And How Is It CalculatedTry to avoid stress For Get Pregnant FastStress can affect the development of your uterus and eggs.

When trying to conceive, relaxing and avoiding stress can help to get pregnant early and fast.Get checked by a doctor before trying to get pregnantIf both of you are in good health, you are more likely to conceive. If you are trying to conceive,So it's a good idea to see a doctor. This is important if you have any health problems or are taking any medication.That you must consult a good mail or femail doctor once before trying. If you are already using any medicine.Or if you have any other disease or problem, the doctor will prescribe you such medicine that will not cause any problem for you to get pregnant.It is important that you tell your doctor that you are trying to conceive.Do not use any medication unnecessarily when trying to conceiveIf you get a fever and take fever medicine. This is normal. If you have a chronic illness.Such as blood pressure, diabetes, hepatitis and gastrointestinal disease and you are using their medicine regularly.Or you are using a drug by following what you heard from people.For example, timing pillsOr a friend of yours used a drug.Due to which your friend's timing has increased or your friend used any medicine. Due to which she has become pregnantAnd this friend or friend suggested you to use these medicines too.So consult your doctor before using any medicine. Medicines that you or your partner are taking.Are these medicines causing any problems for you or your getting pregnant?Unnecessary use of medications can reduce your fertility.And if you use it during pregnancy, it can increase the risk of harm to the pregnancy. Some medicines are not safe to take during pregnancy.Some of them can also reduce your fertility.Before trying to conceive, be sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist about any medications or supplements you may be taking.Reduce smoking to get pregnant fastSmoking can reduce your chances of getting pregnant. Women who smoke are more likely to be infertile.And it may take longer for them to conceive. Smoking can also damage a man's sperm.Smoking does not only include cigarettes, but tea, coffee, alcohol, alcohol and excessive consumption of caffeine can prove to be not only harmful for both men and women.But if you are trying to get pregnant, then it can be a hindrance in getting pregnant. Stop using all of the above drugs before trying to conceive.If you don't finish completely, do less. So that you don't face any problem in getting pregnant.Have a relationship with the same man or woman to get pregnant fastWell, in our society like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and all Muslim countries, this happens very rarely.That one man has relations with many women. And similarly a woman has relations with many men.But there are some western countries where a man and a woman have a lot of relationships with other men or other women.This is proved in relation to Islam and medical scienceThat there is a risk of contracting such diseases by having more relationships and meeting.For which there is no cure like AIDS etcRelationships with more men and more women can reduce your chances of getting pregnant.If you are not yet trying to conceive, be sure to use a condom or companion when you meet a man or woman.Take care of your body and diet To Get Pregnant FastEating healthy foods will help you control your weight and improve your health.Eat all kinds of fruits, vegetables, protein, whole grains and healthy foods.
