Mahima Bedi00:04 27 Oct 23 The best aluminium window and door supplier in Malaysia. Premium quality with excellent after sales Sukhvinder Singh07:21 26 Oct 23 Have dealt with this company several times over the years for several projects including balcony conversion to studio, sliding doors, louvre windows and louvre doors (as pictured). I would like to commend them for their excellent product and services - its not easy these days to find reliable contractors for such things. Am happy to say they have never disappointed me. Special commendation goes to Mr Wong for his great customer service. Sheahnee Iman Lee09:32 10 Oct 23 Great service Phing02:20 14 Sep 23 I hired this supplier to install windows, sliding doors, folding doors, security meshes, and glass panels for my new house. They coordinated the installations with other tasks like flooring (tiles and timber floor) and painting. This made the seamless levelling of the doors and floor surface. They also protected their products with self-adhering films to prevent painting over and scratches, and after finishing, they cleaned everything thoroughly before handing it over. The salesperson, Alex Pung, was very helpful throughout the process, even arranging touch-ups and follow-ups after the work was done. Despite some delays due to MCO, everything went smoothly, and I'm happy with the outcome. S S Ong12:01 26 Aug 23 Being recommended by a neighbour about this company.

We called and they came the next day to replace the handle for?free!!! Tsu Ping Loh06:17 18 Dec 22 Great service from Alex and great work by the team. Very happy with after sales service provided. Would definitely recommend Optima Ed Y07:35 08 Dec 22 Very satisfied with the product, both the quality and coating is great… most of all good customer service jacleen chan06:41 16 Nov 22 The optima windows and security mesh are very high quality and we are very happy with the products Mdm Lim09:41 03 Nov 22 Finally moved in to my new place recently.TLDR : Would recommend for mesh, sliding door, windowsEngaged Optima, via Jerry Chan, for sliding door x3 + mesh (slidingx2, foldingx1) and all house windows (fixed, sliding and swing).Solid build and very impressed by the protection after they completed while my other reno work was still on going. The frames were taped up, the windows had a protective plastic sheet on it. Can embed alarms sensor in the frame as well (alarms from different vendor)Pricing wise competitive (not cheapest, not the most expensive either)Jerry – responsive, attended to all my queries promptly (even after work hours), flexible and ok to arrange for 2 rounds of installation to time it with my alarms vendor’s installationOnce all dirty works completed, Optima’s team came to remove the tapes/sheets and did final touch up!Just need to take note on:1/ actual sliding door opening size – I did mesh and sliding door with 2 fix panel + 2 sliding open. Opening was slightly smaller than expected as the frame is really thick/wide and the sliding door handles eats up about 10cm on each side, thus reducing the mesh opening by 10cmx 22/ swing windows – hidden hinges (for security I guess), therefore can’t hold it in certain angle like conventional swing windows with “control bar”. With current strong winds/rainy season, the windows got blown by the wind and slammed against the frame a few times. Didn’t leave windows opened subsequently.Would be great if optima had some kind of accessory to allow windows to open up to certain angles. Vern12:04 28 Oct 22 We chose Optima for our Safe Net from their high reviews.We're so glad Alex Pung decided to take it up eventho we're in another State.And yes, Optima is awesome! From measurement to choosing the right colour & other expertise, Alex & his team had been a great help.Last but not least, their installation team under Ah Boy, a young Sabahan deserves praise. They did a good job, finishing the installation in 3 days as promised!Worth the $$$ spent! Keep up the good work! Shirley Sim13:19 19 Oct 22 售后服务真心的说，非常棒。那天我家的门锁松了，立马拍了个视频给Alex.两天后，Optima技术团队就上门来检查，才发现是内部的螺丝松了，前后不到1分钟就搞定。我说那么简单的事，你们大可拍个video 发给我，教我怎么做就行啦，不需要大老远跑来，只是为了帮我锁紧螺丝。团队的师傅（对不起，我忘了问名字）说，没关系，这是他们应该提供给顾客的售后服务。说完后，还帮我检查其它门窗的开关及把手，框边的塑胶等等。这样的售后服务，我觉得没后悔安装他们的产品。加油~赞赞赞。 CHU KOON SIANG12:08 08 Oct 22 The mesh grill and sliding glass door we ordered are solid and of great quality. Highly appreciate the staff fantastic customer service by Alex Khor - patience, non-pushy and most importantly helped solve problem and give good advices. We decided to change the old grill with another mesh grill door because of the level of service. Their product is of premium price but definitely worth every penny we invested! eddy Leow14:37 17 Sep 22 I had my Optima windows and doors installed about 4 years ago. Thanks for good job done Alex! I only had a slight problem with one door hinges this week and Alex help promptly. I appreciate it so much Alex. Thank you. Badariah Arshad04:15 13 Sep 22 Optima Windows and Security Mesh is a great products. So far very happy with the products Ee JerHann01:58 04 Sep 22 Its a good quality product, the windows and mesh security. The 12 year warranty gives you peace of mind. Chan Wai Seen03:17 12 Aug 22 I have the Optima Swing and Slide Door, Optima Folding Door and Window, Optima Casement Windows and Optima Fixed Windows installed into my new house. From the initial discussions up until the complete installation of the doors and windows, Mr. Alex Khor has been incredibly helpful and quick to address any issues encountered and goes out of his way to assist his clients in all matters and provides his inputs based on his experiences in the construction/renovation field.Though they are based in Sungai Buloh, they had no issues with installing the doors and windows for my house in Ipoh.The windows and doors operate smoothly and seamlessly without any noise or difficulties. I chose the bronze glass windows which allows plenty of natural light into the house and provides a warm soft glow in the interiors. The quality and workmanship of the doors and windows are top notch and feels heavy duty, which provides a reassurance that the doors and windows are built to last.While my house is still under renovation works, Optima have ensured the safety and cleanliness of the windows and doors by having both the glass as well as framing covered and protected by a layer of coverings.The price of the windows and doors inclusive of installation is definitely competitive in the market. While Optima's factory is located in Sungai Buloh, their price inclusive of installation was more affordable than the price quoted in Ipoh. Premium quality windows and doors from a premium and distinguished company at an affordable price.I would highly recommend Optima Windows and Doors. Victor Ho03:24 14 Jul 22 Good quality! Angie Ng12:45 17 Jun 22 Beautiful and Quality products.. very happy that i found Optima!!

I did a few survey on other brands for security mesh door in the market and in the end, we decided to engage Optima for a very simple but pertinent reason. The 2 other brands that came for site inspection told us it was a "mission impossible" to fullfil my requirement to install a mesh security gate at the front of my main entrance due to the peculiar structure of my front entrance BUT Optima managed to solve this impossible task for us with a high quality outcome. Really appreciate the team's effort and willingness to go extra miles to allow us for our dream to come true ..and what 's best.. with a reasonable price!Thanks again#Alexkhor.
