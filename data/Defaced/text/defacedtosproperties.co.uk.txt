See what they are saying about us. This agent was genuinely helpful for us as a group of 3 postgrad students at Warwick trying to arrange accommodation whilst none of us where anywhere near Coventry. Fast to respond to questions and communications and was extremely helpful when a somewhat abnormal situation came up regarding our guarantors.
