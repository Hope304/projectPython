Barbagiuans – Barbagiuans Skip to content Toggle navigation Home About Team News Contact Donate EN / FR / IT Welcome to Barbagiuans #THE HEART OF THE ROCK I am very proud and honoured to continue the Barbagiuans’ adventure. This association brings together my passion for football and my desire to support causes that are important to me, in the principality. Louis Ducruet, President We are Barbagiuans About Founded in 1980 at the instigation of Prince Albert II, the « Munegu Autu » group, which later became the « Barbagiuans of Monaco », is basically an unofficial football team that brings together some of the sovereign’s friends. The aim was to travel to the four corners of the world, both for charity and for the simple love of football. We are now an association that seeks to bring together former Monegasque footballing glories and other personalities linked to the principality, under the same shirt. All of this around our president, Louis Ducruet, and under the benevolence of HSH Prince Albert II. Learn more Team After more than 40 years of existence, the « Barbagiuans of Monaco » team continues to fulfil its development objectives on a daily basis. It now has more than sixty members. Most of them are key figures in Monegasque football (Didier Deschamps, Ludovic Giuly, Sébastien Squillaci, Fernando Morientes, etc.) combined with amateurs, who have very close ties with Monaco. This sought-after mix makes it possible to preserve the very essence of the « Barbagiuans », while adding value and professionalism through the presence in the squad of some of the former figures of local football.
