For generations, barns were symbols of family pride, hard work, and success in farming. Not only do barns serve to feed the land through agriculture and livestock care, they also provide symbolic landmarks in our otherwise flat midwestern landscape. Historically, barns were integral pieces of the post-and-beam architectural style which combines strength with beauty - a combination which is disappearing due to modern barn construction techniques and materials. To preserve this piece of history in America, we must take action now to save these iconic barns before they disappear forever.MoreMission - Vision MISSION: Indiana Barn Foundation supports the preservation of historic Indiana barns.
