Because your business is our business. our covid-19 response ASA Law Group has made it a priority to be very active in helping the community. Notably, we are committing to provide 750 meals, per month, to the Chicagoland area for families that are unable to access food due to shortages. We will continue this initiative until we all make it through this challenging time. Also, ASA is supporting Illinois Million Mask Mayday by way of donations which will allow the organization to create fabric masks for distribution so as to preserve N95 masks for those that need them the most. As I have always maintained, while we are attorneys by profession, we are human beings first. As such, our primary responsibility is to each other. It is my hope that through our efforts, we are able to shine a light on ways other businesses and individuals may become involved.
