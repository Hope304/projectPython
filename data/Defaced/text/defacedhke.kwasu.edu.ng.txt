The initial name of the programme was Kinesiology, Health Education and Sports Administration not until the 2015 accreditation, when the National University Commission directs that the name be changed to Human Kinetics and Health Education in tandem with the Universities. Surprisingly, the Department that started with just about eleven (11) undergraduate students of inception could now boost of over a hundred students that cut across all the levels, in fact, the Department has graduated six (6) sets of students starting from 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019, 2019/2020, 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 academic session. Based on the glamour by our ex-undergraduate student to advance their academic pursuit in their alma Mata, the Department decided to give this post graduate programme a trial and for the fact that there exist sound and highly qualify faculties, to teach and existence of facilities, equipment including a heart of the century Library and Laboratory. Beefed the staff needs and along the line, the Department has recently faced an accreditation exercise by the National University Commission where the programme was awarded full accreditation precisely in November, 2017 and November 2022. The department commenced the Master Programmes in three specialized areas in 2018 and has graduated three sets of students and still counting.
