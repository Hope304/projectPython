In 1987, the first school, Akal Academy, was officially started at Baru Sahib. Later, in 2013, the first IB school in Himachal Pradesh was established on the campus of Baru Sahib, adding CAIE to it later. In the beautiful and salubrious surroundings of Himachal Pradesh exists a world untouched by the maddening crowd of the cities- Baru Sahib. Known as the divine valley of peace, Baru Sahib was envisaged by the greatest and venerable saints of the present era, Sant Attar Singh ji way back in the early last century. This is the place where children from all parts of the world are nurtured together with value based education coupled with modern scientific spirit making them evolve as pious and strong human beings, from their body, mind and soul.
