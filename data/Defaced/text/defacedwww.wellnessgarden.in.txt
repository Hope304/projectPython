General HealthRejuvenation Naturopathy Yoga “I am feeling so rejuvenated after my wonderful detox. The place is stunning, so calm and peaceful…” Karishma Kapoor, IndiaAtmanthan, Maharashtra Lifestyle PainDiabetes Naturopathy Ayurveda “When I first came in for this Wellness Retreat, I had apprehensions circling my mind because, as a diabetic, I’m a slave to the same kind of food and routine because that’s the key to maintaining your levels. I took the leap of faith and I’m glad that I did because it gave me an insight to how wondrous our bodies are… I walked out more confident and less on my external insulin dose requirement” ​Aishwarya Sakhuja, IndiaAtmanthan, Maharashtra General HealthRejuvenation Ayurveda Yoga “Over the past year I’ve been going to Rita to regain balance in my life. Her comprehensive approach to healing is highly effective. She provides simple day to day advice that includes meditation, body work, nutritional supplements that are catered specially to me. Most recently I experienced her PanchaKarma program. The process helped me release many physical and emotional toxins and make room for healing, love, and overall rejuvenation. Rita is a beautiful teacher for self-reliance, her work is truly healing and transformative.” Noemi, Non-Profit Leader, U.S.A General HealthRejuvenation Ayurveda Yoga I had been working with a homeopathic doctor for a LONG time on health concerns including mold toxicity and POTS – which impacted my thyroid, mood, skin, gut, etc. etc. I was on a lot of expensive supplements, and wasn’t sure if they were even working. Finding a holistic approach was so lovely, in that I had someone who was giving me extra support in working toward my goals AND every suggestion she gave me always worked. Working with her helped me strengthen my immune and nervous system. I also loved the masks and skincare products she made for me to treat acne!” Brooke, Filmmaker, U.S.A Gut HealthGut Health Ayurveda Yoga “After seeing Western doctors with only pharmaceutical answers I was fed up. Found Rita through a local yoga studio’s detoxifying workshop. Came to Rita with a laundry list of chronic issues: IBS, sleeplessness, anxiety. After only a few months of simple and very effective holistic suggestions, as well as some energy clearing, my laundry has been taken to the cleaners!” Amy, Film Industry Professional, U.S.A General HealthRejuvenation Naturopathy Yoga “We came for a health check and left 6 days later feeling 10 years younger, lighter, with a magnificent clarity of mind.” MRS. & MR. Ward, U.KSoukya, Bangalore, Karnataka. India Lifestyle PainDiabetes Ayurveda Yoga “My wife and I spent 20 days at SOUKYA. We came with some medical issues that we wanted to work, we found more than we expected and with a much deeper understanding of our bodies. The doctors, the therapists and other staff have made this experience unique. We definitely will come back and recommend it to our friends. SOUKYA is a beautiful place to recharge the spirit.” MRS. & MR. CARLOS, PanamaSoukya, Bangalore. Karnataka. India Joint PainArthritis Naturopathy Yoga “Next time I will not wait so long to come back. I would not have a better experience, after struggling for 6 years and trying 4 different doctors, you are the one who changed my life. Thank you so much, all my symptoms are almost gone and I am much stronger in one month.” Ms. Kidder, U.S.ASoukya, Bangalore. Karnataka Weight ManagementFat Loss Ayurveda Yoga “I cannot imagine any better place for total recovery. When I arrived, I was completely overworked, after my stay of 8 nights, I feel not only much better, but I also have lost a few pounds through a perfectly and individually tailored Ayurveda diet – without any starving. I also learned how to practice my Hatha Yoga exercises at home alone. The special breathing exercises and targeted meditation help me to cope well with stress on the job. And the healthy Ayurveda diet, of course, I will keep it.” Jill, US.
