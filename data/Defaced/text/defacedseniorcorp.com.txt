His extensive experience, both as a business leader and political activist, includes testimony before the Government Reform Committee of the U.S. Congress.

They were paying great attention to detail. The provider was very understanding and knowledgeable. They gave me the confidence that I selected the right people to take care of my mother I like that they are very dependable. They are clean and knowledgeable. I thought they were excellent.Jane Wolcott | October 01, 2019They would just go out of their way to help me. My wife was in a hospital for most of the time, and they were willing to take me out there to see her. My wife and I were both banged up. We hadn’t had pancakes in a very long time, and I asked Evelyn if she would make us some pancakes. She whipped some good pancakes right up for us. I appreciate that as much as anything. They were just good people. It was very easy to reach people in the office. I always got an answer to my question. I appreciated that.Jerry Alley | October 01, 2019I would recommended anyone with Alzheimer’s to them. I like their attitude and the girls’ attitudes. I like the people that run it.Joan Dodd | October 01, 2019They ask me what I need help with, and they do whatever I need. Whenever I need them, they are available. They help with all of my needs, and I am so glad that I have them. I like that they do the laundry for me, and I couldn’t be more pleased.Barbara Venzke | October 03, 2019My mom has around the clock care, and if it was not for the care, she would have to be in a nursing home.Stacie Kravchak | October 07, 2019They were dependable. I will be calling them again; you can count on that.George Shallenberger | October 09, 2019”Seniorcorp caregivers in the home with my loved one allowed me to go to work.
