The plant also looks amazing on my office table and it is slightly bigger than the image mapped on the website ‚Äì (that‚Äôs a good service). Overall a very happy purchase.

Adding plants to our homes is a simple and inexpensive way to make our living spaces look nicer and improve our physical and mental wellbeing. Add moisture: Plants release moisture into the air through a process called transpiration, which can increase humidity levels and reduce the risk of respiratory problems. Improved health Plants Remove toxins: Many plants are natural air purifiers and can remove harmful toxins such as formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from the air. Better Air Quality Boost mood: Being surrounded by plants can reduce stress levels and improve mood, creating a more peaceful and relaxing environment.
