About Me Contact Me My Message With a college-age daughter and son of my own, it is of the utmost importance that we keep pushing for changes in our educational institutions, better study spaces for our kids, affordable after-school programs, and healthy lunches. Our children are the next generation, let’s make sure they’re prepared, together. I have been actively serving our community since before my children began school. As a leader of the PTA, youth sports, and fundraising committees, I am passionate about making our town a better place for our children – and for the future. Successful people do what unsuccessful people are simply unwilling to do.– Jesse Doe Background As an IT Professional, I have come across many domains and profiles.
