Hiroko Ogiwara's official website "Hiroko Ogiwara My Self" <Journalist's work> I am a generation who does not know the war.For the first time, I first learned about the war, and at the age of 27, I interviewed Daijinata Village in Nagano Prefecture for about one year to write a report of Manchuria, "Manchuria and Asama Pioneering".It was when I did it.It was the story of those who returned to Japan by themselves, while being sent to Japan as a national policy during the war, as a national policy, and was left in Manchuria at the end of the war and left in Manchuria.During the war, the Japanese government, which was burning in the ambition of Manchuria's construction, sent many pioneers to a border area in contact with foreign groups as the cornerstone of ethnic peace.However, at the same time as the defeat, those who had advanced the war, such as soldiers and officials, quickly escaped to Japan, and only the pioneer who had nothing to know was left behind in the land of Manchuria.There was no escort, no guns, no food, I lost my brothers one after another, wandered the land of Manchuria with children, but only lucky people could return to Japan.After hearing their testimony, I first learned the word "abandoned".They were exactly those abandoned by the country on the land of Manchuria.The interview was published in a book "Manchuria / Asama Pioneering".It was a report that I finally wrote with my thoughts, but in that book, I gave up becoming a reporter.Because, for me who grew up without knowing the war, it was too terrible, and it was honest that I couldn't take it mentally.I gave up the reporter, wrote articles again in the business world, and when I noticed, it has been more than 20 years.However, even if you write business and money articles, the word "abandoned people" still disappears from my head.I think the country should be for the happiness of the people.It is absolutely not to be a country to step or throw it away.It is a journalist's job to avoid doing that again, and I want to continue this job as a journalist for a lifetime.Hiroko Ogiwara
