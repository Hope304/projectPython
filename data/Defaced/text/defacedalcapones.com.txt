Our waiter's name was Bullets, from the time we met him up stairs in the lounge till it was time to leave, he was the most enjoyable waiter I have ever had. The food, cast, and the whole night was completely enjoyably. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being great, we give Capone's Dinner & Show, cast and crew a 10. WE CANNOT WAIT TO RETURN!!!! Thank you so very much for an enjoyable evening." - Paul & Family from Greenfield, Massachusetts Read more reviews... About Our Gift Certificates Upgrade To VIP Tickets!
