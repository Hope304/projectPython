First, you have to reduce your birth date, the month, day and year into a single-digit. Then add each of the resulting digits and reduce the total to a single digit (1 to 9) or a Master number (11, 22 and 33). Take this example: If you were born on July 13, 1976, your Life Path Number will be calculated as follows: Month: July is the 7th month so this is 7. Day: The date of birth is 13, reduce this to 4 (1 + 3 = 4). Year: The year of birth is 1976, reduce this to 5 (1 + 9 + 7 + 6 = 23, then 2 + 3 = 5) Add all the resulting single-digit numbers: 7 + 4 + 5 = 16; then 1 + 6 = 7 Your Life Path number is 7 Copyright © 2019Jeevansarrathi Powered By Jeevansaraathi
