HEAD OF DEPARTMENT WELCOME ADDRESS Welcome to the Department of Civil Engineering, Kwara State University, Malete. In our department, we are committed to excellence in teaching and research to safeguard high-quality standards among our graduates and promote evolution and technological advancement. We seek to attract students who demonstrate creative analytical thinking, persistence and discipline, self-motivation, and intelligence. As the engineering field is extremely demanding, future engineering students must be able to adapt to a new dynamic environment and react positively to new challenges and opportunities. Our students are taught to be independent thinkers, create independent types of work, write technical reports, perform research on different areas of civil engineering, and present their work before classmates and faculty members. The Department also prepares our graduates to become world-class leaders and problem solvers, capable of addressing society’s needs for infrastructure (both public and private), in an African context. We are also committed to delivering a rich educational experience that is focused on student success, before and after graduation. Therefore, I invite you to explore our webpage and learn about the department's undergraduate and graduate programs, facilities, faculty, and research activities. We also welcome contributions in ideas or other forms that may help us to provide better service to our stakeholders as we prepare to collaborate with other researchers within and outside the University. Please do not hesitate to contact me or a member of the faculty and staff for any questions regarding our department and academic programs. We are interested in helping you achieve your goals. With best wishes.
