Connect With Our TOEFL Experts TOEFL Score How are TOEFL Scores determined? Both human raters and computational scoring procedures are used to calculate TOEFL scores. That is done to provide a complete and accurate picture of the competitor's capabilities. While the automated scoring system has the advantage of being objective, it does not assess the language and content quality. Human raters must consider a broader range of factors, such as the character of thinking, substance, and organization. Similarly, you should only reply to one question in each segment. For reading and tuning in, you should answer roughly one question. You should attempt one task each for writing and speaking. For the web-based TOEFL iBT test, the result is four-scaled in addition to an overall score.

Near the end of the test, test takers can check their informal Reading and Listening scores. When your official TOEFL scores are published on the web, you will receive an email notification.
