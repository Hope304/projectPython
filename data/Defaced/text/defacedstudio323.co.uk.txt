What our Client says Ruth We came to the studio for an e-commerce fashion shoot. Beautiful studio. Well equipped. We were a team of 5. Plenty of space, changing facilities. Ted was extremely helpful and welcoming. Dane Working with Ted has been a pleasure. He works in a professional calm and creative manner. Someone who is not only listening to the client’s needs but also understands those needs and willing to try to make the outcome it even better by trying out different creative approaches. Samantha My experience at Studio 323 had been nothing short of amazing. Ted created a very mellow ambiance that made me feel very at ease and relaxed which I know can be hard during a photo shoot in a new environment. I have no hesitation in recommending Studio323 where you will receive professional service and very enjoyable experience.
