About the project - Rhvoice Lab Laboratory for creating votes for Rhvoice Speech Speech on the project of ready -made votes our team to become the voice of Rhvoice Rhvoice on the GITHUB about the project of the first laboratory in the world to create new votes for the domestic RHVOICE speech synthesizer.On the Rhvoice Lab website you can find information about our team, created voices and other useful information.To download the synthesizer itself and other votes created not in our laboratory, refer to the site rhvoice.ru.Rhvoice is the only Russian open source synthesizer with the possibility of choosing different votes, the use of which is available on a computer or phone of any user with disabilities.The creation of new votes will allow you to choose one or another for its separate task for each person.The Rhvoice speech synthesis method uses statistical parametric synthesis.It relies on existing speech -source -source technologies (primarily HTS and related components).Voices are created on the basis of records of natural human speech.They are compact, since only statistical models are stored on users' computer.And although the voices lack the naturalness of those synthesizers that generate speech, combining fragments of the records themselves, they are still very selective and resemble the announcements that recorded the source material.Rhvoice originally supported languages spoke only Russian.Now he also supports American English, Brazilian Portuguese, Esperanto, Georgian, Ukrainian, Kyrgyz, Tatar and many others.Theoretically, support for any languages can be implemented if it is possible to find or create all the necessary resources.Rhvoice supported platforms support Windows, GNU/Linux and Android.It is compatible with standard text conversion interfaces in these SAPI5 platforms in Windows, Speech Dispatcher in GNU/Linux and API to convert text into Android.It can also be used by the NVDA screen directly (the driver is provided by Rhvoice itself).The laboratory operates at the server capacities of the Selectel Data Center Â© 2020-2024 - Tiflo Host
