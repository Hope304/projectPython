As such, the goal is to promote a strong foundation in “the fundamentals”, a deep understanding of the research to extend the frontiers of knowledge within an interdisciplinary framework, and an orientation towards entrepreneurship and/or service that could lead to the continuous development of the graduates At the undergraduate level, our goal is to provide the best and the brightest students with an interdisciplinary education, while preparing them for future leadership and success in the game of life. Every undergraduate student will be required to engage in community service (COBEP) and industrial attachment that will prepare them to work in thereal world and proffer engineering solutions to community-based problems during the weeks of interaction. Furthermore, the students will be required to undertake a two-semester-long final-year project that will develop their research competencies. Experienced and quality academic staff of the faculty are committed to innovative research that has an impact on society. Thus, they have impacted our alumni at both bachelor and post-bachelor degrees and these alumni are doing well in their chosen specialties. Therefore, a warm welcome is extended to all undergraduate and postgraduate students, industrial partners, ministries, departments, agencies of government, and international organizations.
