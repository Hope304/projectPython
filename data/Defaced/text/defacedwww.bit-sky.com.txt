Print Email MT.GOX Credit Annual Conference, a latest disclosure document restores the repayment of the possible repayment of the Mentougou case.draft.The trustees of the bankruptcy Bitcoin exchange MT. GOX planned to clear the cryptocurrency other than BTC and BCH.01 Draft before Wednesday's meeting, the trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi shared the outline of the compensation plan with the creditors on Tuesday.The plan marks an important step in the bankruptcy case.Since MT. GOX has stolen 850,000 BTCs in 2014 and announced bankruptcy, the creditors have been waiting for compensation.According to the MT.GOX liquidation repayment document issued by Kobayashi, the MT.GOX exchange will pay the creditors to pay the creditor's rights to pay the creditor's rights, the creditors of the Mentougou case can choose to accept the fiat currency or cryptocurrency.It is worth noting that the compensation of cryptocurrencies only supports BTC and BCH. In addition, the position assets will be liquidated as cash as much as possible.A previous report showed about $ 621 million in Bitcoin (141,000) and Bitcoin cash (142,000) of Mentougou's account account.This means that if the custodian will be sold on a large scale in the future, it will put some pressure on the market.Affected by the global financial market, the entire cryptocurrency industry is also turbulent.This plan of Mentougou has caused heated discussions in the industry.People are worried that this huge amount of payment may bring huge pressure on the market and indirectly lead to a plunge.Perhaps, the most unstable factor in the short term is how the Mentougou creditors handle the currency in their hands.02 In fact, after MT. GOX was closed in 2014, MT. GOX launched a civil bankruptcy procedure.At that time, due to the rise in bitcoin prices, the scale of assets priced at the yen exceeded its liabilities, and the bankruptcy procedure was terminated. The civil regeneration procedure led by Nobuaki Kobayashi, a trustee Japanese lawyer, was launched to pay off customer assets.After the civil renewal procedure was launched, Kobayashi Shenming sold Bitcoin to fiat currency many times in the end of 2017 and early 2018, and sold about 60,000 Bitcoin, which caused a huge impact on the market.On February 7, 2014, Mentougou suspended the Bitcoin withdrawal business.Bitcoin fell below $ 800 that day.But before February 2014, the highest price of Bitcoin did not exceed 1,200 US dollars, that is, the cost of these batch of Bitcoin creditors should not exceed 1,200 US dollars.On March 25, 2020, the price of Bitcoin shocked nearly $ 6,700. After accounting, the price of Bitcoin rose at least 458%during the suspension of Mentougou.If a creditor holds 1 bitcoin before the suspension of Mentougou, the time price is estimated at the highest $ 1200.Now after unlocking, one bitcoin should be converted into 0.25 Bitcoin, calculated at the current price of $ 6700, worth $ 1675.In other words, according to the minimum return, the creditor's choice of selling for sale is still favorable.It is foreseeable that if this draft officially passed at the creditor's conference on the 25th, 140,000 BTC and BCH are likely to directly flow to the market and impact the current circulation market.The last period of the MT.GOX aftermath plan plan was March 31, 2020, that is, the Mentougou incident that was tangled for 6 years was about to settle down.What will happen on the day of March 31?It may be that the draft is officially passed, or it may be a new plan that is overwhelmed, and it is more likely that it is again the date of submission of the aftermath plan.You need to pay attention to another uncertainty.Background data Founded on March 26, 2020: 348552 Recently updated Huobi Rights Protection Situation Upgraded cryptocurrency plunge, which caused the exchanges to protect the draft liquidation of the Exchange's rights protection.What is Lightning Network?OKEX OTC certification and big merchant recruitment will be opened for a limited time!Binance Six Six: Binance believers does not grow up in the tear, and will perish in the second anniversary of OKB.When it was defended by Huobi, a "drag" popular article Technical White Paper of Hardbit — A Bitcoin Hardware Wallet Bitcoin Oil Poetry Bitcoin Wallet Relational --- One of the 15 Bitcoin of the hardware wallet word beadedInvestment motto Crytsy has a problem with the currency simplified history hardware wallet technology white paper HardBit hardware wallet evaluation 4-22 announcement Announdment's last month old talk about the calculation model of the return rate of Bitcoin mining investment in Bitcoin mining investment and the simplicity of the recent trend of unlimited coins.Effective application ecosystem Litecoin mining machine investment returns calculation to the interpretation of the five ministries and commissions to suppress Bitcoin, the renminbi may become the second ruble to witness a world -class joke, lamenting a national sorrowful spot market plus leverage and the futures market marketThe difference between the difference between the influence of leverage on the market is the theory of Bitcoin.
