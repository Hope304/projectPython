Dr. Shehu Usman Adam Dean, Faculty of Management and Social Sciences • BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FACULTY The Faculty of Management and Social Sciences (FMSS) at Kwara State University, Malete, has a rich and storied history that reflects our commitment to academic excellence and societal impact. FMSS was founded with the vision of becoming a leading faculty in Management and Social Sciences education and research. In a significant development, our new journey began when the faculty was established as part of the defunct Faculty of Humanities, Management and Social Sciences (HMSS) which was one of the founding faculties at the inception of the university in 2009. FMSS emerged as a distinct faculty in 2023, following the unbundling of HMSS into FMSS and Faculty of Arts, orchestrated by the expansion of the hitherto existent faculty of HMSS both in terms of enrolment and degree programmes. This milestone marked a new chapter in our journey, allowing us to focus more intently on our core disciplines and to better serve our students and the broader community. Since our inception, FMSS has provided high-quality education, conducting cutting-edge research, and engaging with our communities to address real-world challenges. We take pride in our commitment to producing graduates who are not only academically proficient but also socially responsible, creative, and equipped to make a meaningful impact on society. As we continue to evolve and grow, we remain steadfast in our dedication to excellence, innovation, and the pursuit of knowledge. We look forward to a future filled with continued achievements, impactful research, and the success of our students and faculty members. Thank you for being part of our journey, and we invite you to explore FMSS at Kwara State University, Malete, as we continue to expand horizons through collaborations, foster critical thinking, and shape a brighter future. • ACHIEVEMENTS/PLANS The faculty achievements since establishment include inter alia; Our staff winning different categories of academic scholarships and grants in local, national and international spheres for research work and academic career advancement.
