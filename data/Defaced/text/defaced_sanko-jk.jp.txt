Children's home facilities Sanmitsujuku (Sanko Corporation Sanko Business Corporation) "As a facility that snuggles with children and families" in recent years, the declining birthrate has been declining, and in last year's statistics, the child population under the age of 18 has become the lowest after the war.The challenges of raising children are piled up, and it is now difficult to raise children alone only by one household.The social system has not been able to keep up with the situation that matches the situation, and the child -rearing anxiety and unstable family situation are increasing.Among them, the case of parents and families abuse of children, the most serious task, has been more than 34,000 in the 2006 Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare statistics.However, these cases are not events that only occur in special families, but are the appearances of child -rearing families and parents' childcare and isolated figures.Some families thought about raising children so hard and could not prevent their children from raising their hands as a result.Nearly 700 consultations have been received in the 24 -hour child -rearing telephone consultation "Happy Talk" that we have been conducting since 1996.This situation is just a matter of thinking that raising children is not only a problem for individual families, but an issue that is considered throughout society as a whole, and it is possible to create an effective social system that consults and supports "child -rearing" quickly.I think it is most important.579 children's nursing homes nationwide are public facilities stipulated in Article 41 of the Child Welfare Law.Sanko Juku and one of them have been opened and operated since 1946.As mentioned above, in a social system that supports "child -rearing", orphanages are working on difficult child -rearing issues from the front and play a role in providing "services on the side of users".It can be said that it is a facility obtained.We hope that children with various issues will create an environment where they can live with a safe and secure living, and to work together with their families to snuggle up to the growth of the children.In order to execute the philosophy of "now, to children", which was stipulated as a basic support standard for child care in the facility in April 2000, in April 2000I would like to set as follows this year in

works as a person who can help child care for 24 hours.The word "difficult era of child -rearing" is realized throughout the day of us.It is also necessary to recognize that child support is not a special family, but what can happen everywhere.In addition, there are many children who are not accepted by the child's "personality as they are" and are suffering from an adult's thoughts.In such a situation, as a familiar person in the community, the children and their families are "as they are" and "I can feel that each person lives richly and cherished.Creating a society that supports you
