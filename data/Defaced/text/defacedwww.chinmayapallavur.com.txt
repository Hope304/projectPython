The great aim of education is not knowledge but action- Education is not merely acquirement of facts but also values which help us to improve Read More GURUDEV'S VISION STATEMENT Children are not vessels to be filled, but lamps to be lit MESSAGES Work without faith and prayer is like artificial flowers without fragrance "Live for others ; there is peace; live selfishly ; there is worry and restlessness." Not to do what you feel like doing is freedom If you realize you were wrong, have the courage to admit it. "How much you have studied is not the question; how much you have moved towards it is what matters." Be like a flower ; give happiness and fragrance to all. Unprofitable talking is a great drain upon one energy. Mind at rest is the Temple of Joy. Smile at life and life smiles at you, frown at life and life frowns at you. "We must learn to be cheerfully silent, gracefully silent, powerfully silent..." The quieter the mind, the sharper the intellect. "Learn to speak softly, always words of live and affection; then friends multiply" "All work is noble when undertaken in the right spirit of selflessness and detachment." "If you want to prove God, improve yourself. This is the only method." "Great achievements are earned not by through proficiency alone; achievements are rewards of efficiency." "Work without faith and prayer is like artificial flowers without fragrance." "Be regular, Be sincere, Make each day a rounded beauty of love, goodness and joy. Live in the bliss of best thoughts, said and done. " "Keep cheerful. In pain, cry. But deep in yourself, know that the Lord is only purifying your inner instruments" Not sickness, but health, is the mystery of life "Good thoughts and noble actions add to your inner personality and make you a greater person each day." "Everybody can make mistakes, but few discover the courage to do the right thing when they discover their mistake."
