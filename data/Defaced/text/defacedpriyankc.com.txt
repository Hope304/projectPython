Priyank ChandraPriyank Chandra About News PublicationsPriyank ChandraAssistant ProfessorLinksAbout MeI am an Assistant professor at the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto, and Director of the STREET Lab (Socio-Technical ResistancE and Ethical Technologies Lab), housed at KMDI. I am passionate about ethical research that can help us understand the sociotechnical practices of marginalized communities. My current work looks at social movements, worker resistance, and accessibility, with a focus on how communities self-organize. My research is interdisciplinary, influenced by research drawn from Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW), and Information & Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD), and theories and concepts from Science & Technology Studies (STS), sociology, development studies, and institutional analysis. I am looking for students and researchers to collaborate with. Please contact me if you are interested in any of the following: designing with communities at the margins social movements informality accessiblity I used to be a postdoctoral fellow at the Thirdspace research group at University of Toronto’s Computer Science Department. In May 2019, I completed my Ph.D. from the School of Information at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I was adviced by Prof. Joyojeet Pal. I hold a MS in Economics and a BE in Electronics Engineering with prior experience in education research and data analytics. Amongst other stuff, I love the following in no specific order - mythology, Carl Sagan, evolution, technology, dragons, Wong Kar-Wai, football, and Douglas Adams.
