Mission: To develop in students, a range of transferable applicable skills in information technology through education in computer science. This will generate in students an appreciation of the importance of computers in an industrial, economic, technological, and social context. The Department of Computer Science is one of the foundation departments of the Kwara State University at its inception in 2009. The department took off during the 2009/2010 academic session with the mandate of running a four-year Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (B.Sc.). The department started with a student population of 46 and academic staff strength of 3. The student population has increased over the year to the increased to the current population of over One Thousand Nine Hundred and Thirty-Six (1,936) in the 2022/ 2023 academic session across the Undergraduate and Postgraduate programs. The program is currently fully accredited by the National Universities Commission (NUC). The Department is domiciled in the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology together with two other departments that is: the Department of Library and Information Science and the Department of Mass Communication. The idea of housing the three departments together stemmed from the need for a cross-breed of ideas at the point of learning so as to produce well-grounded information and communication scientists who will be highly useful to the nation. The Department since its inception has recruited experienced lecturers both from home and away and has equally graduated over a thousand students. Goals: • To train students to be self-starting, dynamic, team player, and entrepreneurial. • To create in students the awareness of and enthusiasm for computer science and its capabilities. • To involve the students in an intellectually stimulating and satisfying experience of learning and studying. • To provide a broad and balanced foundation in computer knowledge and practical skills.
