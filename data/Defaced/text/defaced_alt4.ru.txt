To achieve the necessary parameters and properties, a minimum of components with the maximum quality is always used. The heart of all the devices presented can be considered a powerful DAC. This fee can be attributed to multi -bitate converters of the mixed type. In the resistive matrix, it is used asThe thermometric line of resistors and the auxiliary R2R Matrix. The currents Committed through this resistive matrix are 1000 times more than in ordinary DACs on microcircuits or similar ones. See powerful multibiite DAC. Large power and relatively high voltage, the dull developed by the tsap allows you to connect the load directly to the board (Bypassing the so -called buffer or transducer current voltage). To coordinate the load and board, a transformer is used that can additionally ensure the transformation into a balance signal, or level adjustment, due to the presence of bends. See transformers. Quality power supply is the most important element that determines the sound of the deviceAnd the overall impression of the sound.Preference is given to a parallel stabilizer scheme.A distinctive feature of these devices is that the regulatory element is connected in parallel to the load, this ensures its high speed.Also, the advantages of parallel stabilizers include the fact that, regardless of the current consumed by the stabilizer, the current consumed by him from the power source remains unchanged.This fact is positively reflected at the level of radiated interference (due to the fact that the change in consumption current does not proceed through the transformer and the rectifier bridge).The small level of radiated interference allows you to get low noise and excellent microdynamics output transformers as an attendants output transformers provide optimal coordination of powerful discrete DACs with load (loudspeakers), and simultaneously adjust the volume (stepped volume control).Transformers are made on the basis of high -quality transformer iron (HIB GRADE IRON) or on the basis of an amorphous alloy core.The high quality of materials and the thoroughness of manufacturing provide a wide frequency band and a magnificent bass register.A powerful discrete multibbit DAC built -in micro -opram, an accurate resistive matrix and a balancer of the current load provide high accuracy and greater power.The impressions of listening symphonic records are obeyed without the slightest stress.Orchestral Tutti is magnificent.When listening to complex musical materials, like choral and symphonic works - the sound is excellent, obeyed in one breath.In many records, instrumental passages were found, previously invisible.A large depth of the scene was noted, on which instruments and voices are distributed, which gives a sense of reality of the presence of performers.The scene, dynamics and frequency do not depend on the volume level.The sound does not tire, and even after several hours, listening remains high involvement.The site was created and supported by Altaudio.The contents of the site are an integral part of the company © TM Altaudio 2010-2022 Ankara Escort çankay Escort Ankara Escort
