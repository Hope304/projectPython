Main Party - Croatian stone Donát Main party sidekontactmap pages Main Party Societyisortment Photogallery Contact Welcome to Kameno-donát.cz in the following link you will find a demonstration of solitary stones and fossilized trees.Another video shows the use of some of our materials in an interesting front garden.The characteristic feature of the natural stone offered by us is its originality and the way of processing, ie the fact that it is still largely processed manually.The fact that the stone is truly exceptional building material is evidenced by the fact that despite the fact that we are now surrounded by various building materials, the stone is increasingly demanded and recognized as a natural material that has an important function in the construction and protection of all types of buildings.The tradition of stone processing comes from ancient ancient times, when it was used as the only and basic building material and when it had mainly practical and then aesthetic use.The main activities of the company are not only the sale of stone, we are also dealing with the sale of fossilized wood, teak furniture, realization of gardens and lakes.The materials we supply are from stone processors in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Norway, Belgium, Croatia, etc. We believe that our offer will be interested and will convince yourself of the qualities of the services we provide to our customers.Copyright © Kámen Donat Dymokury 2007 - 2024.
