Since 1994 when we founded P+Y, our commitment has been to continually expand opportunities and make a positive difference for our clients. We believe joining forces with Prosperity Advisers Group allows us to take these commitments to a new level as we blend our own expertise with that of a larger, acclaimed and highly resourced multi-disciplinary, accountancy and business advisory firm.Like all progressive business owners, we have been looking for our own opportunities to grow and diversify. Finding the right fit has taken some years. You could say we’ve been picky!Since meeting with the Prosperity Adviser Group partners 12 months ago, we have taken our time getting to know each of them personally and of course we’ve carefully reviewed their business – quality of advice, services offered and their people.While accountancy and business advisory expertise was a prerequisite, our goal was to merge with a demonstrated business leader, a firm that was proactive and innovative, but most importantly, we were looking for a genuine cultural alignment.Prosperity Adviser Group is 35 years young, multi-award-winning and like us, they are proud of their team which they describe as ‘pre-eminent professionals’ and they continually invest in them through professional development and education.They too, are client centric offering a multi-disciplined 360 degree approach to advice that includes specialist expertise all under the one roof such as advisory & tax structuring, financial planning & wealth management, superannuation & SMSF services, business succession planning and access to lending and salary packaging services. We feel confident, Prosperity’s very high quality advice and commitment to client care combined with our own, will continue to deliver innovative solutions and the best possible, multi-faceted outcomes that adds tangible value to businesses. In November, we will relocate from Paddington to our new offices on Level 22, 333 Ann Street, Brisbane.Apart from changing our name and location, it will be business as usual and we look forward to our continued working relationship. We will be in touch again soon to provide our updated contact details and any required actions from you. As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. Yours sincerely, Brenden Yantsch DirectorDavid PennellDirector We want to work with you.
