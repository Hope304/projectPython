Dr. Chala Feyera, Dean of The College.Agarfa Agricultural Technical Education and Training College (ATET) is one of the five Federal Agricultural Colleges administered under the Ministry of Labor and Skills, and it aims to produce skilled workforces that are intended for the agricultural sector at the intermediate level, based on the country’s agricultural development policy and strategy. Since its inception in 1982 as the “Agarfa Multipurpose Farmers’ Training Center”, offering six months of training to 16,322 farmers, Agarfa Agricultural College is an institution that has successfully completed three national missions. As agriculture is the pillar of our nation’s economy, the College is producing qualified development agents to provide the required human resources for the sector. Established in the Oromia region Agarfa district of Bale Zone, on 4,224 hectares of land at an altitude of 2350 to 2365 meters above sea level with an annual rainfall of 750 – 1000mm and temperature of 6-250C, Agarfa College is located 458 km to the east of Addis Ababa. It is an attractive place surrounded by a river, natural grace, and fertile soil. Agarfa is a unique place holding a diverse national community serving the college with love, respect, and cooperation. The climate has been favorable not only for human beings but also for livestock, horticulture, crop and crop production, and all sectors involved. The training center grew into Agricultural College in 2001 and was named Agarfa ATVET College as a three-year diploma training program. It is our intention to work beyond the regular training to make it possible for the local community to take advantage of a variety of short courses and advanced technologies. In the future, maintaining the natural environment, using local knowledge, and engaging the local community on any issues of the College will be our top priority. We actively work on maintaining the quality of technology-based training; continually strive to improve administrative services, internal organization, and qualified human resources. Our college, therefore, calls upon governmental, non-governmental, private sectors, and investors to contribute to supporting the training that our college is discharging. Abraham Tesfu Beyene, Academic Vice DeanAgarfa Agricultural technical vocational education and training college (AATVETC) is a large public institution working to provide quality agricultural education through training, innovations, and extension services for improved agricultural productivity and livelihoods, managed by the ministry of work and skill. Its main mission is to produce level I – IV professional development agents who meet national standards in Animal Science, Plant Science, Small-scale irrigation development, and Natural Resource Management. In 2022, the college has also launched a new department in land administration and Continuing Education Program in the evening and weekend in all departments. In addition, Agarfa ATVET College aims to provide interest-based short-term training for rural young people, farmers, and governmental and non-governmental organizations, as well as to duplicate and transmit advanced technologies to local farmers and pastoralists to increase production and productivity. Each department provides 70% practical experience in various experimental farms and laboratories and 30% theoretical training through lectures and other didactic forums. The training at Agarfa ATVET College follows an outcome-based training system where trainees are enrolled from regional states based on the specific needs of the agricultural offices in each region. Regular program students will complete their studies according to the level of training they are admitted to the college, but not more than 3 years. The college has access to one large library for all departments and they also have access to the college’s ICT Center, equipped with very fast broadband Internet service and a well-organized Registrar serving all departments. Currently, there are 1460 trainees at the college and it has since trained over 10855 students in the regular program.Finally, the college community and academic staff are committed to contributing to national economic development by producing highly disciplined and skilled trainees. Therefore, I welcome any stakeholders who would like to help and support us to achieve our goals.Fraol Edao, Technology Multiplication and Transfer Vice Dean Serach Recent Posts የተማሪዎች ምረቃ የ2015ዓ.ም የተማሪዎች ምረቃ የምርት ስብሰባ የፀረ-ሙስና ቀን አከባበር አጋርፋ ወረዳ city cup የስፖርት ውድድር Recent CommentsArchives June 2023 March 2023 December 2022 Categories Uncategorized Address Bale, Robe, Agarfa, EthiopiaTel : +251-911-490870 ,+251-911-490871, +251-930108007, +251-911-228239 Email:agarfacollege2012@admin.com,chalafeyera115@gmail.com Recent Posts የተማሪዎች ምረቃ የ2015ዓ.ም የተማሪዎች ምረቃ የምርት ስብሰባ የፀረ-ሙስና ቀን አከባበር አጋርፋ ወረዳ city cup የስፖርት ውድድር Find us in google map © All right reserved 2022
