Brief History Of The Department The Department of Special Education started from a humble beginning. Right from the inception of the Kwara State University, the pioneer Vice-Chancellor, Professor AbdulRasheed Na’Allah conceived the idea of having a department offering a degree programme in Special Educational Needs and Inclusive Education as one of the pioneering departments in the College of Education of the University. With the take-off of the Kwara State University in 2009, the pioneer Provost of the College of Education, Professor Noah O. Oyedeji, invited Dr. J.O. Olukotun, from the Department of Special Education, University of Ibadan, to prepare a proposal for the establishment of the Department to run a degree programme in Special Educational Needs and Inclusive Education. A curriculum package was then developed by Dr. Olukotun who, on 16th June 2010, fully joined the University as a Senior Lecturer to further prepare the ground for the smooth take-off of the Department. In line with his forward-looking vision for creating a university with unique academic programmes for addressing the challenges in the nation’s education, the Vice-Chancellor, Professor AbdulRasheed Na’Allah, invited Professor Linda Meloy, a Professor of Special Education from Western Illinois University, Quad–Cities, Moline, IL, USA, to re-design the degree programme in Special Education Needs and Inclusive Education and to make it similar to degree programmes in Special Education as obtained internationally especially in the United States of America and Canada. Professor Linda Meloy arrived at Kwara State University, Malete, on 25th October 2010. In the company of Dr. Olukotun and Dr. Olorisade, Professor Meloy visited several public and private schools, Kwara State Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Ilorin, Federal College of Education (Special), Oyo and the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, for need assessment for the degree programme and the creation of avenues for collaboration with Kwara State University. Professor Meloy submitted a report of the visit to the Vice-Chancellor before leaving the University for the United States. Professor Meloy returned to Nigeria in March 2011 for 2-week visit to further work on ensuring that a proper foundation is laid for the Department of Special Education in Kwara State University, Malete. However, it was not until 2012 when Professor Emmanuel Olaiya Aina, a Consultant on Early Childhood Education from California State University, Los Angeles, took over as Provost of the College of Education, that frantic effort was made to ensure that the Department of Special Education together with another department, the Department of Kinesiology, Health and Sport Science, commenced in the Kwara State University, College of Education, during 2012/2013 Academic Session.
