ABOUT CPI-GENEVA Cordoba Peace Institute The Cordoba Peace Institute – Geneva (CPI) is an independent non-profit organisation working on peace promotion. We focus on tensions and polarisations in all societies where Muslims live and aim to enhance theoretical and practical conflict transformation resources in Muslim majority countries. Read more CPI-GENEVA METHODOLOGY Conflict Transformation We endeavour to transform the relationships between parties to conflict, to minimize the use of violence. We encourage them to deal with direct, structural and cultural causes of conflict. Collective Shared Knowledge In our reports and papers, we ensure that the analyses, conclusions and recommendations issued are shared by a diverse panel of actors from different backgrounds. Find Out More ⟶ Capacity-Building​ We empower parties to conflict and enhance their capacity to analyse conflicts and to master non-violent approaches to dealing with them. Find Out More ⟶ Safe Mediation Space​ We provide safe mediation spaces to enable parties to conflict to interact directly with the “other” in a protected and respectful atmosphere. Our facilitation role in a mediation process includes identifying key issues to be addressed, organising face-to-face meetings and maintaining a channel of communication between parties. Find Out More ⟶ Diapraxis​ We use dialogue as a means of arriving at practical solutions to problems, which can be jointly-implemented by conflict parties (this is known as “diapraxis”). Our experience shows that developing shared actions in an inclusive way goes further in building trust between diverse actors. Find Out More ⟶ Conflict Analysis​ We undertake extensive, thorough desk and field research in the early stages of a project, and consistent follow-up throughout our activities. This research helps us develop knowledge and networks that ensure the credibility and acceptability of our processes and projects. Find Out More ⟶ Building Trust​ Our experience has shown the importance of building confidence and trust with all parties; particularly with “credible” actors. The success of our work depends on an atmosphere of common trust and shared goals. We take time to ensure that our interlocutors are convinced of the genuineness of our intentions in each project. Find Out More ⟶ Why support the CPI? Since 2002 the Cordoba Peace Institute – Geneva has worked to promote constructive dialogue and peace in and with the Arab and Muslim Worlds. This work has never been more urgent. Mission Our mission is to promote dialogue and empower people for the prevention of violence and for peaceful conflict transformation in societies where Muslims live. The spirit of the Institute and its vision The name of the Institute recalls the spirit of enlightenment and mutual respect that ruled in 10th-century Cordoba, called the “Capital of the Spirit”, which remains an almost unique model for dialogue between civilisations and the cross-fertilisation of ideas and learning. What we do The Cordoba Peace Institute – Geneva (CPI) is an independent non-profit organization working on peace promotion. We focus on tensions and polarisations in all societies where Muslims live and aim to enhance theoretical and practical conflict transformation resources in Muslim majority countries.
