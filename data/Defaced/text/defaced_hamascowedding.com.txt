I am the third child of five siblings.Both of my parents work as farmers in Brebes.Yess and now I am 12 years old.my husband is Javanese but mixed Sumatran's blood right in Palembang ... the name of Reza's husband, and my child there are 3 guys all gaiss ,, and I am the most beautiful at home, I started to like and finally fell in love with the world of beauty at first because of the wedding ceremony during the wedding eventI make the results less satisfying the results, starting from there I think how I can make up in other people and it turns out I can and keep learning.Yeyy then at the beginning of my interest in makeup, I started learning about makeup from the tutorials that were on YouTube in the end I really like to make up people.There is a sense of satisfaction and pleasure yourself to make or turn the face become more cool hehehe.Because my husband also really supported that I finally continued to go to school again specifically for professional makeup artists.In the middle of taking a make up school, I began to dare to take the outside client. Alhamdulillah barakallah so far my client really likes from the results of makeup to the durability of make up through out the day.I really hope I can become a professional make up artist that many people like and in the future have a team and make up school myself.Hamasco Wedding Your Professional Wedding Service Portfolio Hamasco Hamasco Wedding Our Service Make Up Prewedding Make Up Wedding Make Up Engagement Make Up Graduation Video and Photography Catering and Tent entertainment and Wedding Decoration Choose your service here Hamasco Wedding Tent & CLICK CLICKYou have to choose us Hamasco prioritizing the Wahid Make Up service in directly held with the owner of the package price can be adjusted to your budget Many facilities obtained are handled by the makeup professional can request the makeup makeup guarantee all the wedding events are neatThe best -selling wedding package takes the promo now what they say ??Testimonial What My Clients Say Ka Isyah Tks Tks Y Ka Dewi Make Up I really like it ... other things if I have an event again to call Hamasco ... ðŸ˜˜ Ka adel, the results of the makeup are very good ... thanks to Dewi Hamasco Ka Fitri Cirebon thanks a lotHamasco has helped from beginning to end.I'm sorry if it's a bit fussy hehe, hehe, I really like the makeup, so much, TX, Ms. Dewi, Ka Zaki, Kakk, Dewi Thanks, that's how much you makeup!My friends are good, good makeup, how come my friend is a friend of my child, but I want to makeup in Sis Dewi too, so I don't know, sis, sis, sis, sis, sis, sis, sis, sis, slicleSonggom thanks, mba Dew Hamasco.Friends all say it's really different to be beautiful ,, hehe our location Gallery Hamascojl.Ahmad Yani Gg Taqwa Rt 12/01 Slatri Village Larangan District Brebes Regency 52262 Phone 087730081005 E-mail rezakamarullah480@gmail.com Facebook-F Instagram Whatsapp Booking Your Wedding Date Here Home About Contact Home About Contact Â©.Valentine Day Exclusive Savings!Join Our Mailing List and Receive an Exclusive 45% Coupon Code Yes!I want to save 45% no thanks i don't want to save
