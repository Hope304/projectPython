Our Testimonial Layover night stay I was very happy with the service provided.the hotel rooms were very nice.we we very tired n exhausted with the travel with my baby.it came like a big relief with I came to know about the hotel.thank u for ur service.the food served was very good n reasonable.good portion.will surely come again. Mr Very reasonable price and good for transit passengers. Was stayed on 4th June night due to my over night flight. Very helpful and friendly staff. Was bit disappointed about the room service staff as I asked room temperature comes which he bought cold and when I asked him to change he refused to do so. Anyway I will going to stay in future. Very convenient and comfortable Due to covid flight schedules my next flight was 23 hours away. Did not have to go out of the airport at midnight. Very conveniently located. Very clean and comfortable and good service. Took test and had a hot shower, nice breakfast and then checked out before the flight. Took the stress out of travel. Awesome Short visit to hotel Very nice hotel inside T2 arrivals of mumbai international airport. Its a transit hotel for international passengers. We liked the ambiance and rooms very much. Earlier whenever we had to transit through mumbai we had to either wait at airport or search for a hotel outside airport and that was very hectic, but this is very easy. Fantastic customer service. I booked wrong date by error, but without any hesitation Mr Aamir Zariwala changed the date for me. Also Aamir and his colleagues were very helpful while I checked in and allowed to checkout couple of hours late. Hotel Room was Fantastic, very neat and clean with lovely breakfast and room service. I would definitely recommend to book Niranta Hotel at Mumbai Airport while transit and would 100% recommend. Mr Abdul Patel The gentleman who works at the reception Amir was so helpful and he made my stay very comfortable. Stay blessed Aamir. I will be coming to India again from the UK and hope to meet again. Hope all staff in hotels are like you. Abdul Patel - UK Our Gallery Frequently Asked Questions 1. Where is Niranta Located? Ans.
