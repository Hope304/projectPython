Dr. Hahnemann espoused the law of cure known as "Similia Similibus Curentur", or "Like Cures Like". This means that a remedy that produces symptoms in a healthy person will cure those same symptoms when manifested by a person in a diseased state. This law of cure has been verified by millions of homoeopaths all over the world since the time of Hahnemann. The Organon of Medicine (revised six times), we see the fundamentals laid out Materia Medica Pura records the exact symptoms of the remedy provings. The Chronic Diseases, Their Peculiar Nature and Their Homoeopathic Cure. Dr. Clemens Von Boenninghausen M.D. (1785-1864) Admin Dr. Boenninghausen was born to one of the oldest noble families of Westphalia, Germany. His full name was Clemens Maria Franz Baron Von Boenninghausen. He was Baron by inheritance, a lawyer by profession, and an agriculturist by natural inclination. It was in 1827 that he developed purulent tuberculosis. The outstanding contributions to the advancement of Homoeopathy by Boenninghausen were: Classification of Characteristic Symptoms Compilation of the First Repertory of Anti-Psoric Remedies. Pocket Manual of Homeopathic Materia Medica Boenninghausen's Characteristics Materia Medica and Repertory Lesser Writings of Boenninghausen Testimonials What Doctors Say Stories of Success of our students/Happy Users “Homoeoadda offers a blend of learning, participation and integration of enduring principles of homoeopathy.

He established the fundamental principles of the science and art of Homoeopathy. He is called the Father of Experimental Pharmacology because he was the first physician to prepare medicines in a specialized way; proving them on healthy human beings, to determine how the medicines acted to cure diseases. Before Hahnemann, medicines were given on speculative indications, mainly on the basis of authority without experimental verification.
