Brief History of the Department The Department of English and Linguistics was established in 2009 at the inception of the University as the Department of Language and Linguistics with Professor Femi Abodunrin as the first Head of Department. The University separated the linguistics programme to form a new Department of Linguistics and African Languages in 2011 with the Department renamed as the Department of Languages and Literary Studies. It then came under the headship of the late Prof. M.E.M. Kolawole. The Department now accommodates the B.A. English Language and Literature and the B.A. Linguistics and Yoruba Programmes.
