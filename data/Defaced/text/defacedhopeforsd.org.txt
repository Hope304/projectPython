But peeling back the veneer of beauty, we're faced with a deep brokenness that stubbornly resists the radiance around it. Our neighbors are struggling with homelessness, hunger, and poverty. Many are excluded from opportunities to thrive. Tragedy and pain lurk just beneath the surface of even the most affluent and well-groomed communities. Despite the beauty of its sunsets, San Diego’s shadows are as dark as any city’s.Vulnerable, oppressed, estranged, and abandoned right next door to you 9,000 HomelessCalifornia tops the U.S. for its homeless population, and San Diego ranks fourth among U.S. cities with its persistent problem of homelessness. $810m Trafficking profitsModern day slave owners profit almost as much from trafficking sex as from trafficking drugs.

Volunteer Donate “Seeing all these people helping us, just because they want to, really makes me see there is good in the world. I never thought anybody ever would just do good to someone else for no reason.” Trafficking SurvivorGenerateHopeOur strategic focus areas HomelessnessEach of the more than 9,000 without homes in San Diego County has his or her own story—often a series of tragic events—that includes such complex issues as unemployment, mental health issues, physical disability, addiction, abuse, and serious health crises. Solving those underlying issues requires an approach that addresses the whole person. By investing in holistic support and recovery, Hope for San Diego seeks life transformation rather than merely more warm beds.Sex TraffickingTraffickers in the growing and insidious sex trade use threats, coercion, and violence, forcing victims to sell their bodies, exploiting human beings that can be sold over and over for tremendous profit. By raising awareness about this hidden blight, Hope for San Diego mobilizes our community to care for the many survivors fighting to rebuild their lives. Refugees & ImmigrantsRefugees and immigrants are some of the most vulnerable in our community, lacking knowledge of the legal, monetary, social, educational, and community systems that are the basic building blocks of life here. Hope for San Diego welcomes refugees and immigrants, offering tools to help them navigate this new system with the goal of building social and economic self-reliance.Foster CareChildren in the foster care system are drastically under-served and their outcomes reflect that reality: high rates of incarceration, mental health challenges, teenage pregnancy, unemployment, and an exponentially increased probability of being trafficked or homeless. Caring deeply for these most vulnerable of children, Hope for San Diego equips families to foster and adopt, supports these families, and connects volunteers with the needs of at-risk children.
