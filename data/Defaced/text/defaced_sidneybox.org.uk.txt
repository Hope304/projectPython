Sidney Box - Home page Sidney Box web: www.sidneybox.org.uk Sidney Box was a champion... a champion for workers. He didn’t like the way things were, principally the way working people were exploited, but unlike most who suffered in silence or simply complained, he set about changing things with a determination that was irresistable. The characteristic, his inner strength, is what set him apart. The truth is, Sidney Box was a pioneer who overcame his disadvantage, who withstood the resistance of the establishment, and used it to fight for what was right for his family and his fellows. In fact, he fought for us all. Such a man should not be forgotten, so here is a place where his memory can be awakened, where we can build a clearer picture of this modest man, and perhaps take something into our own lives for the betterment of the people around ourselves. Sidney would have liked that. Home | Bio | Book | Articles | Help | Voice | Resources | Site map Web design, CMS & SEO by Hereford Design Copyright © Sidney Box.com 2009
