The CDC says HPV is the MOST common sexually transmitted infection (STI). 90% of men and 80% of women will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives. In 2015, HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer (base of tongue, tonsils, soft palate) became the most common HPV-associated cancer, surpassing cervical cancer. HPVANDME is dedicated to supporting people affected by HPV: patients, partners, and caregivers. The Rise of HPV Throat Cancer WHAT IS HPV+ OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER? HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer is now the most common HPV-associated cancer, surpassing cervical cancer in 2015. HPV causes 70% of oropharyngeal cancers in the U.S. More than half of cancers diagnosed in the oropharynx (base of tongue, tonsils, soft palate) are linked to HPV type 16. Currently there is no approved routine screening test for HPV infection in men or of the mouth and throat. That’s why recognizing possible symptoms is critical to early cancer detection.

THE ANTI-CANCER VACCINE The HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) protects against nine strains of HPV including 16 and 18, the two high-risk strains that cause most HPV-related oral, genital, and anal cancers. Prevents the development of over 90% of six HPV-related cancers Approved by the FDA for ages 9 through 45 years old Recommended by the CDC for males and females, ages 9 to 26 The HPV Vaccine HPV AFFECTS EVERYONE Anyone who is sexually active can get HPV. About 14 million Americans, including teens, are newly infected every year. High-risk HPV types (16,18) cause about five percent of all cancers worldwide. Many countries have developed publicly-funded HPV vaccination programs. 47 million women worldwide have been fully vaccinated as of 2014.
