VIC Silistra Start | Contact | General Conditions | Links | To the Old Version Submission and Sewerage Ltd. - Silistra Instantial Service Service Reference Payment of the County of the Buyer's Election 80 (Public Procurement) Entrancer 8 tel.For accidents, to reduce the difference between the total and the apartment water measures fellow citizens, due to the increasing cases of differences above 20% (according to the regulatory framework) between the common and individual water meters, "Water Supply and Sewerage" Ltd. Silistra wants to give the following explanation: This is due to the factthat weak leaks of toilet cisternity, mixing batteries and others may not be covered by apartments with low -grade water meters, but these weak leaks added to the overall moment of water consumption are reported by the main water meter.Thus, only the difference of the accuracy of apartment water meters accumulates the difference of the total water meter.It is for this reason that VIC Ltd. Silistra has decided, in order to avoid the accumulation of such differences due to the accuracy of the measuring devices, to introduce a requirement for all new mounted water meters for the minimum class of accuracy "B" (according to an ordinance) or analogous"R> 63".That is, when the water meter is for horizontal mounting, the following designation "BH" or "HR = 63" (minimum).When the water meter is for vertical installation to have the following designation: "BV" or "VR = 63" (minimum).Suitable water meters can be purchased from the Inkasso Department of the company.We note that these are minimal requirements and the distributed difference will only be insignificant if the classes of accuracy of the main water meter and apartment water meters are the same.Of course, all this is in force if there are no illegal deviations, the collector has removed all the testimony of all water meters in the input and the pipe system meets the requirements (the correct diameters are selected, limestone deposits are missing, according to the building project).Disrupted water supply on Hadji Dimitar Street in Silistra23.02.2024 "Water Supply and Sewerage" Ltd. - Technical District Silistra, notifies its subscribers: Learn more combined water supply of part of Aydemir21.02.2024 "Water Supply and Sewerage" Ltd.Silistra notifies its subscribers: Learn more combined water supply in Silistra on Dobrich Street, from №101 to №11715.02.2024 "Water supply and sewerage" Ltd. - Technical district of Silistra, notifies its subscribers: Learn more combined water supply in the village of Sratsimir village, Bulgarian village and Bogorovo village06.02.2024 "Water supply and sewerage" Ltd.-Technical district of Silistra, informs its subscribers: Learn more combined water supply of Petar Boyadzhiev Str."Ltd.-Silistra, Technical District Silistra informs its subscribers: Learn more marked water supply on Eledzhik Street, Vladaya Street and" Transfiguration "Street in the village of Kalipetrovo23.01.2024" Water Supply and SeweNotify your subscribers: Learn more news to stop the congestion in the sewer!
