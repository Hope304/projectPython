My PhD thesis was on “A Mechanistic Understanding of Light Olefins Selectivity in Methanol-to-Hydrocarbons Conversion on MFI”. In 2017, I joined the research group of Prof. Johannes A. Lercher at the Technical University of Munich to focus on X-ray absorption spectrosocpy and density functional theory calculations. Since 2021, I am a Group Leader at the Chair II of Technical Chemistry headed by Prof. Lercher at TU Munich and lead projects involving X-ray absorption spectroscopy, sulfur chemistry, electro- and photochemistry, and polymer upcycling using ionic liquids. I am interested in combining kinetic and mechanistic studies with operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations to gain fundamental insights into industrially relevant heterogeneous catalytic systems. recent publications Structure-Activity Relationships in Ni- Carboxylate-Type Metal-Organic Frameworks’ Metamorphosis for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Xiaoxin Ma, Daniel J.
