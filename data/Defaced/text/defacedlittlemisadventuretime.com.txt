#LittleMisadventureTime for sale #LittleMisadventureTime 1987 Volkswagen Vanagon Westfalia I bought it in 2015, lived in it for half of 2015 / all of 2016 with my then girlfriend, and have had many amazing adventures in it.

This is a 35 year old classic card that's used for adventuring, there's gonna be some imperfections. Let's think of it as: the good, the bad, the ugly. There's lots of the good listed above. There is no the bad. Below are a few places of the ugly. Three are very small, one is medium. Shotgun door lock key doesn’t work from the outside, can be fixed Driver door map pocket screw loose Backseat table arm swings out on its own, even when tightened down, without something stuffed under it (towel) Under window rust spots Needs new brakes (pads or rotors, not sure which) A few rust spots below the rear window, key for scale A few rust spots below the rear window, key for scale Bonus If you otherwise drink beer and you buy my van, you get three six packs of Fort Point Westfalia Nuremberg red ale. What makes it Westfalia beer? Nothing, per se. They just named it that. And put a cool little illustration of a Westy (with the top popped!) on the box. You can only get this in California because they don't ship across state lines. It's not super rare or anything, just and little extra treat. Bonus treat (if you drink…): three 6-packs of a beer from San Francisco named "Westfalia" Shane Becker (801) 898-9481 veganstraightedge@gmail.com
