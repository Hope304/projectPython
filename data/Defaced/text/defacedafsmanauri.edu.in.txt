Their world is highly influenced by their schooling environment as they spend most of their childhood in classrooms & school corridors. Thus, schooling has the greatest impact on an individual's life. It should enable a child to blossom into a well-balanced person, rich in morals and values. The purpose of education is not to restrict oneself to impart bookish knowledge but also inculcate humanitarian values like wisdom, compassion, courage, humility, integrity, and reliability of a student. We believe in holistic education of your child, which encompasses - academics, co-curricular activities, sports education, and life-skills learning's. We endeavour to strike a balance between state-of-the-art infrastructure and a wholesome education. At Air Force School Manauri, we impart education that is based on conscience, and we rear a breed of young minds that are bustling with self-confidence, motivation and ever ready to take up any challenge life throws at them. The campus, sports and academic facilities all bear testimony to this effort.
