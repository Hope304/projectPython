High Scalability Ongoing exploration of new consensus algorithms, cryptography, and network structures drives innovation to overcome scalability obstacles. Safe & Secure As long as you choose a trusted exchange, your crypto will be safe. However, if you go this route, make sure to set a very strong password for your exchange account. Why Choose Us Centralized exchanges can be used to conduct trades from fiat to cryptocurrency (or vice versa). They can also be used to conduct trades between two different cryptocurrencies. While this may seem to cover all of the potential transaction types, there is still a market for another type of cryptocurrency exchange as well. The reason for this setup is that banks offer security and monitoring that an individual cannot accomplish on his or her own. In the case of a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, the same principle applies. Transactors trust not only that the exchange will safely complete their transactions for them, but also that it will make use of the network of users in the exchange in order to find trading partners.
