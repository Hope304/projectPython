Welcome to TyliaFlores.com The human spirit is one of ability, perseverance and courage that no disability can steal away. In keeping positive I would like to share some inspirational quotes I have found to help motivate me on a daily basis. Hope they can help you too… “I do not have a disability, I have a gift! Others may see it as a disability, but I see it as a challenge. This challenge is a gift because I have to become stronger to get around it, and smarter to figure out how to use it; others should be so lucky.” ― Shane E. Bryan “My advice to other disabled people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn’t prevent you doing well, and don’t regret the things it interferes with. Don’t be disabled in spirit as well as physically.” -Stephen Hawking Check me out now on TikTok DISCLAIMER: THIS IS THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE OF TYLIA FLORES.
