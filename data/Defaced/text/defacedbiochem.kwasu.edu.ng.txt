Degree in Biochemistry in 2014. At inception, the Biochemistry programme was domiciled in the Department of Biosciences and Biotechnology and this continued until 2017 when the Department of Biochemistry was carved out of Biosciences and Biotechnology and domiciled in the School of Basic Medical Sciences. Mission/Vision Statement Philosophy: The B.Sc. Degree Honours in Biochemistry is a four-year programme designed to teach the fundamentals of Biochemistry as an integral part of the “Life Sciences” having special emphasis on the “Chemistry of Living Things”. Objectives of the programme: The Objectives of the KWASU Biochemistry programme are: 1. To provide students with a broad and balanced foundation of biochemical knowledge and practical skills 2. To develop in students the ability to apply knowledge and skills to solving theoretical and practical problems in biochemistry. 3. To develop in students, a range of transferable skills that are of value in biochemical and non-biochemical employment. 4. To provide students with knowledge and skills base from which they can proceed to further studies in specialized areas of biochemistry or multi-disciplinary areas involving biochemistry. 5. To provide, through training and orientation, an appreciation of the salutary rewards of inter- and multi-disciplinary approaches to the solution of complex life problems. 6. To generate in students an appreciation of the importance of biochemistry in industrial, economic, environmental, technological and social development. 7. To instill in students a sense of enthusiasm for biochemistry, an appreciation of its application in different contexts and to involve them in an intellectually stimulating and satisfying experience of learning and studying. Our Programmes HEAD OF DEPARTMENT WELCOME ADDRESS I warmly welcome you to the official web page of the Department of Biochemistry, Kwara State University. I hope that by going through this page, your interest in the department will be enhanced and you will find the content appropriate enough for your search. Biochemistry is a science that provides explanations for life processes at the molecular level. A biochemist, therefore, is a person involved in studying the chemistry of living systems. The subject of study in biochemistry is the chemical processes in living organisms, and its history involves the discovery and understanding of the complex components of life and the elucidation of pathways of biochemical processes. Much of biochemistry deals with the structures and functions of cellular components such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules; their metabolic pathways and flow of chemical energy through metabolism; and how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells. It also focuses on the biochemical processes involved in the control of information flow through biochemical signaling, and how they relate to the functioning of whole organisms. Research The values of the department include, among others, high educational quality and institutional discipline, a vibrant and dedicated team, passion for fairness, firmness, thoroughness and diligence. Because of the array of staff with expertise in various areas of Biochemistry, coupled with the availability of modern research equipment, the department carries out research in various fields of biochemistry including enzymology, phytomedicine, industrial biochemistry, cancer etc. Achievement and Milestone The KWASU Biochemistry programme is fully accredited by the National Universities Commission and has produced graduates of biochemistry who are presently employed in the university and other educational institutions, research institutes, and pharmaceutical industries etc. Our Staff Dr. Raliat Abimbola Acting Head of Department Email:raliat.aladodo@kwasu.edu.ng Prof M.
