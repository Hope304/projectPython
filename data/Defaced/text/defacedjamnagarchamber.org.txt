JADEJA PRESIDENT It gives me great pleasure to serve in the Presidential capacity for the Jamnagar Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Together, with all other Office Bearers, we will continue to evolve our chamber into a dynamic organization which is able to support businesses with the upcoming challenges and opportunities that arise. By working together to create an effective and purposeful business climate, we can grow and prosper. Jamnagar Chamber of Commerce and Industry is privileged to have a considerable and diverse membership, abundant with business experience and piercing expertise. We derive our support also from the membership of various associations of Jamnagar who also serve on our panels. We understand that our strength lies in our ability and willingness to work together and to contribute our time and talent to nourish a robust and energetic organization vital to the Jamnagar business community. As a business community, we all share the same challenges. We are faced with a growing, but somewhat fragile economy. Over the past year, our main focus has been coordinating chamber events and initiating several activities directed towards steering local businesses out of the quagmire of the complexities in the business environment. Functioning in the business world is full of challenges and we help the local businesses adapt to it and adopt a proactive approach towards dealing with it. Businesses also have to deal with the challenges of compliance, risks and governance. JCCI acts as an advocate for all the local businesses. We are distinctively alert in assisting the local businesses to effectively face these challenges. By leveraging the collective strength and talent of our members, we are able to influence public policy related to the businesses and the overall economic development. We continue to be hopeful as we look toward the future. Our will to succeed is found in knowing that we are not alone, and now more than ever, it is critical that we work together, hand in hand, to find solutions and effect change. Strength in numbers lends weight and credibility to our message, and it is the backbone and foundation of a Chamber of Commerce. We invite you to join us in our quest to build a stronger and more prosperous Jamnagar. Invest in yourself, your business and your city by becoming involved in the Chamber. The Chamber will serve as your trusted partner in business growth. Our goals are to engage every business, build a stronger network of businesses and enable growth opportunities. We welcome your participation. I look forward to working with everyone who is associated with this chamber. If you have questions pertaining to your business or business in general, feel free to reach out to me or anyone from the Office Bearers, and we will provide you with the best information possible.
