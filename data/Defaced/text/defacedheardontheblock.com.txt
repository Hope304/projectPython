OnTheBlock is a Houston-based company founded by a millennial homeowner that wants to make owning a home less stressful. When our founder, Matt Gype, bought his first home he didnâ€™t know the first thing about how to take care of it. And just like you, he was too busy to remember to do the things around the house he actually knew how to do. How much does OnTheBlock cost? It is free! We will be rolling out premium features in the future to help you save more money, but that is completely optional. For no cost, you get access to our maintenance recommendations, home inventory tracking, document storage, and more. How long does it take to set up OnTheBlock? Setting up your home(s) with OnTheBlock takes minutes. Weâ€™ve worked hard to make it simple to use OnTheBlock. As soon as you create an account, a maintenance plan is built, and reminders are automatically created. Can I do all of the maintenance suggested by OnTheBlock? We worked to keep the maintenance recommendations super basic (I needed to ensure I could do them myself). However, specific tasks call for a professional, and we will let you know what those are. If I canâ€™t do a task myself, can I contact an expert through OnTheBlock? Not yet! Right now, we are 100% focused on giving homeowners like you the smoothest experience. We plan to roll out features to help you determine potential costs and find the best option for your budget.
