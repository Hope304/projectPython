From Ahlen I thank Ms. Ms. Quinten for making her manage to get me out of the years of exhaustion.By measuring the fatty acids, I realized that my cells were totally inflamed and where the causes were for my condition.Thanks to their solution with the balance concept, I managed to get out of the inflammation after 150 days and become fit and active again.I wish you a lot of success from the heart and many people the opportunity to use this path for themselves.Christine O. from Worpswede I am a doctor and have a practice for alternative therapies.I got to know Jasmin Quinten on a training course.She told me about her balance concept and I tried it.I am thrilled with this concept!I feed my body very well with it and have felt more powerful and very healthy since then.I have now also recommended it to other patients, with Jasmin fifth being and is a very great support for me.I would like to be accompanied by her at any time, both for my clients and for myself. ”Birgit G. from Vienna Thank you very much, Jasmin, for your competent advice.I met Jasmin about a year ago.Since I have been paying attention to my diet for a very long time, I was curious how my blood values look.I was horrified when I received the result-my Omega-3: Omega-6 value was far below average.Half a year later I was in balance again.I also like to recommend my clients to Jasmin because I know how much body and mentally/mental well -being influence each other - one is not possible without the other.Contact Tel. 0162/75 32 46 0 Mail info@praxis-quinten.de Office hours appointments by telephone.Imprint dispute settlement data protection sitemap
