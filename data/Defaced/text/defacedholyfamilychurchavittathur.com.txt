Because of the distance and tedious journey they wanted to have a church of their own in Avittathur. The ardent desire and strenuous effort, along with god's grace their dream came into a reality in 1878. In this church Rev. Fr. Poulose Chittilappilly Pozholiparambil gave the spiritual leadership and those who came after him also worked hard and brought it up to be a model parish in the diocese of Irinjalakuda. Today this parish with 500 families shine in the catholic church in the realms of Socio-Spiritual and cultural activities. Shortcuts Latest News Read More Welcome to our website...
