Make yourself at home, take a cup of cocoa and enjoy your stay. Some of the stories and characterprofiles are still only available in german language (my native language) ... sorry for that - I'm working on it. This site went online in late 1999 the first time and began with just StarTrek drawings. Since then this side is growing constantly and added other stuff too. You can visit me on deviantArt too... I wish a good time and would be pleased about feedback (german or english please).

Jadzi posted a blog entry form 28.04.2023Hey all So... what did you think of Star Trek Picards final Season? I loved it. Especialy because they didn't kill off any of NextGens Main Cast. I was really worried and it would have kind of ruined it for me. But as much as I loved Picard I really hope that if they made a new StarTrek show with new Characters they will do it episode wise like StrangeNewWorlds or the 'older' Shows... because frankly: Making an 13 hour movie, cutting it into 13 episodes may work for a cast consisting of predominantly known characters (Like with Picard or the Marvel TV Shows) but not to introduce 10 to 15 new characters (more or less main). Discovery is prove. We had 4 seasons and only 1 storyline in each season. Naturally the main leading character must be the focus so after 4 seasons I know about Burnham, and a bit of Saru but thats it. All the other Characters: what do we know about thek other than their jobs and their main love interest if they have one. All the other StarTrek shows had the possibility to focus episodes on other characters than the main lead. We started to knew bits of their lives, their quirks, their needs... they grew upon us. Heck after two seasons ST:Picrads I knew more about Raffi than any of the bridge Crew combined after four seasons of discovery. Yeah... these are my two cent :D hugs Jadzi give feedback Nickname Comment add comment Jadzi posted an update on 29.03.2023 onArt Projects & Fan Art => LandscapesFor my birthday I got some Acryl and Oilcolors and Canvas from my parents so I tired them out: Jadzi posted an update on 16.12.2022 onArt Projects & Fan Art => LandscapesNew Picture added in Landscape - I played a bit around in Krita and with some Brushes found online Jadzi posted a blog entry form 06.06.2022FEDCON Blues... Oh my gosh... what a weekend. It was awsome. First they had Vaughn Armstron, Casey Biggs doing the RatPack Show with Nana Visitor and Max Grodenchik - which was a challenge when you get up at 4am to make a 5h drive and still be awake at 9pm to enjoy but we did it! - then they had f**** Simon Pegg!!! and Christopher Eccleston. Not to mention the other super nice guests...
