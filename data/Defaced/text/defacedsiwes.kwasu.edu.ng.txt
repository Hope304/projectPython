MISSION: To equip students with the necessary practical knowledge and technical skills for self-employment and effective involvement in Nigeria's industrial growth.

The Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) is mandatory for all undergraduates who require industrial training for skills acquisition involving training, learning and working, as stipulated by the National Universities Commission (NUC). Participation in SIWES is a requirement in fulfilment of the conditions for the award of a Degree in specific programmes/courses in the University in the Faculties of Agriculture, Engineering and Technology, Education, Information and Communication Technology and Pure and Applied Sciences. The Industrial Training Fund (ITF) initiated SIWES in 1973 to bridge the gap between theory and practice in courses such as Engineering and Technology, Sciences, Agriculture and other professional programmes in Education in Nigerian Tertiary Institutions. The Scheme is a skills training programme designed to expose and prepare students of Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Agriculture and Education for the industrial work situation they are likely to meet after graduation.
