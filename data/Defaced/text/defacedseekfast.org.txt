Shawn Zhang Software Engineer Beijing, China As part of my professional and also personal activities, I have to manage a very large quantity of documents in multiple formats. When you need to search for a document with a keyword in this mass of documents, your software does the job with incredible precision. The reliability of your software is almost perfect. In other words, this software, in the rapid search of documents represents for me an essential tool. Bernard Oliva Senior Health Executive AP-HP Sorbonne University Paris, France I find it hard to believe that in 20 years of hunting for a search engine that does what I want that SeekFast would be the ticket! I have downloaded at least a dozen programs over the years, but none did the job I needed and ALL of them did that tiresome indexing that was of little help for my needs. Now you have solved it for me! Count me as a HUGE fan and endorser of the software! I think I could sell it to anyone who wondered what it would do.
