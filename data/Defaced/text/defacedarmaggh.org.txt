To achieve this, the association has been consistent in developing training courses and seminars to help its members update their skills so they can be the advocates of good records and good governance in their institutions.

INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES MONTH ARMAG NEWSLETTER Editor’s NoteIt is my pleasure to introduce ARMAG’s maiden newsletter. It is the editorial committee’s hope that the newsletter will be a vehicle for sharing, information and inspiration for colleagues so we urge everyone to make this newsletter their own by contributing to its various sections.In this inaugural issue we have two articles that discuss the lessons we can learn from other records and archives contexts. While ARMAG vice-president Isaac Armstrong’s article focuses on what Ghana can glean from the United States’ National Records and Archives Agency’s M-19-21 policy for its RTI implementation, former president of ARANZ, Eric Boamah discusses what we can learn from our colleagues and sister association in New Zealand. University of Winneba Archivist Baaba Bonuedie reflects on how her professional experiences have demonstrated the intersection of archives, records and information management.In future, we plan for the Spotlight section to feature one archival repository’s collections and activities. In our first Spotlight section, however, we introduce five archival institutions which were featured in our inaugural Archives Month celebration.Edwina Ashie-Nikoi, PhD.Lecturer, Department of Information StudiesUniversity of Ghana, Legon Download Newsletter >>> NEWS Archivists And Records Managers Association Of Ghana (ARMAG) Train Members On E-Records And Digital ArchivingELECTRONIC RECORDS & DIGITAL ARCHIVING TRAINING EVENTS Archivists And Records Managers Association Of Ghana (ARMAG) Train Members On E-Records And Digital ArchivingELECTRONIC RECORDS & DIGITAL ARCHIVING TRAINING the best package for our members membership pricing STUDENT No fees for all events except for paid member eventsFree Webinars/Seminars and WorkshopsIndustry best practicesAccess to Whitepapers, industry research reports, and academic papersARMAG NewsletterReferrals for paid internshipsCareer Counseling“Student to professional” mentorship programJob referrals Sign Up PROFESSIONAL GHS 120.00 Free access to all member-only content created by ARMAGDiscounted fees for all eventsFree Webinars/Seminars and WorkshopsFree Sign-up with AIIM InternationalDiscounted rates for local and international conferences and eventsIndustry best practicesAccess to Whitepapers, industry research reports, and academic papersARMAG NewsletterExpert advice from seasoned professionals Sign Up INSTITUTION GHS 500.00 Free access to all member-only content created by ARMAGDiscounted fees for all eventsFree Webinars/Seminars and WorkshopsFree Sign-up with AIIM InternationalDiscounted rates for local and international conferences and eventsIndustry best practicesAccess to Whitepapers, industry research reports, and academic papersARMAG NewsletterExpert advice from seasoned professionalsFree Information AuditReferral for contractsDiscounted rates to Info-Vendor forum Sign up Archivists news from around the world News from the National ArchivesIrish American Heritage MonthWomen’s History MonthNational Archives and Arlington National Cemetery host discussion on Freedman’s VillageNew Fulbright Scholar Joins National Archives Heritage Science Research and Testing LaboratoryConservators Clean National Archives Rotunda Following Vandalism IncidentNational Archives at Kansas City Reopens Exhibits to PublicNational Archives Supports Efforts to Digitize Important Records from Puerto RicoNational Archives Showcases Historical Coal Mining Communities with New Photography ExhibitNational Archives Celebrates 10th Anniversary of David M.
