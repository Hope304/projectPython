I just joined, see a lot of comments from fellow lovers of reading and poetry ECT. There are so many quotes, I want to study so I can be like Rory Gilmore and use them in everyday lingo. lol. Knowing exactly who people are quoting before they even say it is the goal for me. Does anyone have any advice on how I can better obtain and reach this goal? more »LikeReply 92 years agodmcs359Hello from British Columbia, Canada, Isabelle! I inherited my love of the written word from my (now deceased) Mum - it has saddened me to see what is becoming of the English language in all its forms - and beautiful handwriting, which Mum and all my Aunties (& a couple of Uncles!) had - they were all born in a different time, the 1910s-20s - I'm not suggesting we revert THAT far back, but the more time I spend on Social Media sites, the more appalled I am at the inability to spell basic words correctly.Well, now that I've gotten that off my chest... when I want to find quotes of a particular genre, I simply type those words into Google! Welcome to the STANDS4 Network, I highly recommend you check out all the other 'pages' - the list is colour-coded at the bottom of this page. more »LikeReply 112 years agoisabelle_hThank you for taking the time out of your day to write such a kind and encouraging response! I, like so many others, haven't failed to contribute to the disregarding of correct writing, from grammar to spelling, of the English language. So much so that it seems to have become somewhat of normality to me. Increasingly so, the more time I spend on Social media. I can't say my age but, I don't think it hard for others to guess I'm a gen Z, just based on my spelling and grammar, etc. I'm so glad I found this network! I hope to better myself in all things literary through it! more »LikeReply 52 years agodmcs359...and I'm so old (almost 63) I don't even know what a "Gen Z" IS, lol! I'll Google it in a minute - I'm a proud Baby Boomer, the way the world has changed from microwave ovens (I don't remember how I lived without one for the first 24 years of my life, I had to save up for a while to get one, they were about $750 back then!) to the insane advancements in technology... I really love the years I've lived in and watching the growth (and sadly, the strife) of the decades I've been part of! My father was a Military Lifer (jet fighter pilot) starting in WWII, I'd been to 17 countries by the age of 16.What genre of books do you enjoy, Isabelle? Are you familiar with the website "Grammarly"? If not, I think it'd be "write" up your alley (pun intended on the word 'write for right', lol!) I enjoy crime/mysteries, Kathy Reichs is one of my favourite authors. It's a pleasure chatting with you - have a great day! more »LikeReply 52 years agodmcs359Oh my goodness, Isabelle - I just looked up what a "Gen Z" is... you're a baby, lol!

With all due respect, you might want to check out/add the extension for the STANDS4 Networks "Grammar" site, or Grammarly.com - both are great to help you with spelling words correctly. (it's spelled 'appreciate', not 'appretiate') I'm not sure about the STANDS4 one, but Grammarly will correct your spelling automatically (if what you've typed is in the ballpark, Grammarly seems to have a "sixth sense" about the word you want spelled correctly - it's quite amazing, actually!) As well, if you've typed an 'awkward' sentence or two, even a paragraph, Grammarly will suggest a more concise & clear way of saying what you want to say. Again, danwise, my comment is meant to be helpful, not critical - I hope you take it with the respect intended! more »LikeReply 11 year agoHappytobealiveSo grateful to have found thus website!
