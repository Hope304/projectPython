So you want to help with WebKit? Blog post by PulkoMandy on Fri, 2024-03-01 12:00 WebKit, webpositive This blog post was originally a forum post. It is reproduced here on the website to make it easier to find and reference. I heard that some more people may be interesting in helping with WebKit. So here is a summary of the current state, the things I think need work, or the possible future paths to explore. Keeping WebKitLegacy up and running The Web moves fast these days. So we have to stay very up to date with upstream WebKit. PulkoMandy's blog Read More Haiku Activity & Contract Report, January 2024 (ft.

The arguments are that (1) the current format has severe limitations which limits the aesthetic value of the current formatting, especially when modern C++ language features are used, and (2) it is not a good use of the time of Haiku‚Äôs contributors to modify and maintain custom logic in the haiku-format tool (derived from clang-format). If the proposal is adopted, any new code contributions will have to use the new formatting style, and contributors are required to reformat any declarations that they modify. nielx's blog Read More Haiku Activity & Contract Report, December 2023 Blog post by waddlesplash on Fri, 2024-01-12 22:00 contractor, activity report This report covers hrev57429 through hrev57493. waddlesplash's blog Read More Haiku Activity & Contract Report, November 2023 (ft.

Many of these can be installed from HaikuDepot. This is the first article on this topic, but it may become a regular (quarterly?) series. Let me know in the comments what you find of these notes, and what else you think should be covered. nielx's blog Read More Haiku Activity & Contract Report, September 2023 Blog post by waddlesplash on Thu, 2023-10-12 21:30 contractor, activity report This report covers hrev57257 through hrev57308.

It‚Äôs worth noting: the main Haiku CI is currently offline as the developer who was hosting the build machine moved to a location with much slower internet. A new build machine and home for the CI has already been selected, but isn‚Äôt fully online yet, so the nightly builds are a bit behind at the moment. waddlesplash's blog Read More [GSoC 2023] VPN Support Project Final Report Blog post by Pairisto on Sun, 2023-09-10 23:29 haiku, software Project Overview This project, undertaken as part of Google Summer of Code 2023, sets out to implement a robust TUN/TAP driver for Haiku given the increasing demand from the community for a virtual network kernel interface. This project allows for VPN software and other network-related utilities that work with TUN/TAP driver to operate seamlessly on Haiku. Throughout the project‚Äôs duration, I‚Äôve documented the rationale behind key design decisions, and offered insights on the interplay between the TUN/TAP driver and Haiku‚Äôs unique networking architecture in my series of seven progress blog posts.
