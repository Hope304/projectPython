Student-Hobbyist Electronics Projects Tutorials by Lewis Loflin Introduction - The purpose of these pages is to introduce the student and hobbyist to electronics projects. I've been a part-time adjunct professor at a local community college teaching electricity and electronics. Today I do this for the shear love of electronics. I have 45 years experience in electronics, from vacuum tubes to modern solid state and industrial controls. I tend to teach from a general science viewpoint. This site has been up for about 18 years and covers a number of subjects broadly how to use the Arduino microcontroller and semiconductor components such as transistors, MOSFETs Zener diodes, op-amps, etc. These are presented as information only - you assume all risk. Most voltages are under 24-volts. Read this safety warning. New January 2024.

The link are a list of the videos. Here I demonstrate the use of four microcontrollers. Note the following links: Arduino Microcontroller is the most popular hobby device programmed in C/C++. This is open source with a large community base. That is most of what I use. There are several variations. Raspberry Pi is a small computer more powerful than a mere microcontroller. It is often operated with Linux running C or Python. It operates as a low-end PC. It has no connections for a hard drive or onboard clock. A solid state drive can be connected with separate hardware through a USB port. This also has programmable GPIO pins for connecting external hardware. I present many hardware and programming examples. PICAXE Microcontroller is based on a Microchip PIC controller with a built-in basic interpreter. It is used for teaching beginning programming to students. I think it is the best for operating simple controls and easy to use. It have a much smaller community than Arduino. I present a number of circuit examples. Using PC Printer Ports is section on how to connect electronics to a PC printer port. This can be programmed under Linux using a special type of Python or in C. The Linux desktops with this and Raspberry Pi are identical. Only the hardware interface differs. PIC18F2550 is a powerful and complex controller produced by Microchip. This is programmed in C with Microchips MPLAB. PIC16F628A and PIC16F84A are lower end Microchip controllers. They are easy to use but take more practical electronics skills. I program them in assembly with MPLAB and present a number of examples. H-Bridge Motor Controls An H-Bridge, in general, is a 4-switch (often a type of transistor) circuit used to control the direction of a permanent magnet DC motor. Through the use of a microcontroller, speed and direction can be controlled. In the illustration above, I used 4 MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors) wired in an "H" configuration. These diagrams include bipolar transistors, IGBTs (insulated gate bipolar transistors), or combined devices. With both SW1 and SW2 open, the two n-channel MOSFETs (U2, U4) are turned on, switching both sides of the motor to ground. The motor is off. Press SW1 and U2 turns off, U1 turns on. This combination creates a current path from U1 through the motor to U4 to the ground. The motor rotates, say, clockwise. Release SW1 and press SW2 U4 turns off, U3 turns on creating a current path from U3 to the motor to U2 to ground. The motor direction of rotation is reversed. The circuit above has limited uses. Things get interesting when combined with a microcontroller or PLC (programmable logic controller) I present many circuit examples using several devices. These are working circuits built and tested. These are tutorials, not commercial circuits.

There are broadly two transistor types: MOSFET and bipolar. There is a third type known as an IGBT, a hybrid of MOSFET and bipolar. Another subtype of the bipolar transistor is the Darlington, used for high power gain. There are important differences besides varying voltage and current ratings. Their operation differs: a MOSFET is voltage controlled; a bipolar transistor is current controlled. An IGBT is voltage-controlled but acts as a bipolar transistor. We explore these circuits in detail.

So we use various forms of driver circuits. Small transistors can drive larger transistors. Opto-couplers can provide voltage isolation and can drive other transistors. We have circuits such as the TC4420 integrated circuits that can do both. There is a separate section on optocoupler circuits below. MOSFET-Transistor Drivers with TC4420 and TC4429, IGBTs, etc. Introduction TC4420-TC4429 MOSFET Drivers Use TC4420 MOSFET Driver for Simple H-Bridge Circuit TC4420 MOSFET Driver Various Circuits TC4420 MOSFET Driver Replacement Circuits Optical Isolation of H-Bridge Motor Controls Opto-Isolated Transistor Drivers for Micro-Controllers Basic Bipolar Transistor Driver Circuits Test Power MOSFET Transistors, IGBTs Results, Observations High current TTL MOSFET Driver Circuit Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor IGBT Circuits Optocouplers for TTL-CMOS Logic Level Shifting Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor IGBT Circuits VOM1271 Photovoltaic MOSFET Driver Circuits Bidirectional Solid State Relay Circuits Simple Solid State Relay for Low Power LED 120V Lamps Build High Power MOSFET Directional Switch Relay Digital Circuits Basic TTL Tri-State Buffer Circuit Examples Tutorial NOR Gate SR Latch Circuits Tutorial NAND Gate SR Latch Circuit Return to main Menu Test Reuse Surplus Personal PC Power Supplies Power Supplies Power supplies come in three types for the hobbyist: build, buy, or salvage.

It consists of a Hall plate that outputs a "transverse" voltage based on the intensity of a magnetic field - polarity is dependent on magnetic polarity. It also consists of a high gain differential amplifier because the generated voltage is small. The output voltage is analog, usually centered around half the power supply voltage. The addition of a Schmitt trigger with a properly set hysteresis will create a Hall switch or Hall latch. They often have an open collector output transistor.

These can use operational amplifiers (op-amps) such as the LM358 or LM741. Or one can use the LM311 comparator or LM339 quad comparator. They have open collector outputs unlike the LM358 or LM741 op-amps. A comparator "compares" two analog voltages and turns on-off based on their voltage levels. Often considered "digital" at this point, we have, in reality, a one-bit analog-to-digital converter.

The emphasis is hardware control which suggests one has an electronics background. Having a background in digital logic and binary code is also helpful. The projects will explain this as needed. What differs here is I avoid the use of Arduino-only code and code libraries to port the basic code algorithm to Python, PICAXE basic, or Microchip PIC C.

PICAXE Microcontroller Projects The PICAXE Microcontroller I use is the medium-range PICAXE-18M2. While built hardware-wise on a Microchip PIC controller, it has an easy-to-learn built-in proprietary basic. PICAXE is for students rather than serious, commercial applications. The PICAXE series of micro-controllers rank as the easiest and most cost-effective way to use Microchip processors. I wanted an easier and less expensive way to introduce my students to the "PIC" microcontroller. I plan to get those starting past poorly written literature and lack of simple working code examples.

Raspberry Pi and Linux Raspberry Pi is an ARM processor-based mini Linux computer clone. It has addressable hardware IO for connecting external circuitry. These projects are in Python, a high-level interpreted language finding many modern applications. Currently, there are four models, with the Model 4 being the most powerful. I have interfaced a Raspberry Pi 1 to an Arduino microcontroller, DS1307 RTC, and LCD in the above image. The pages below cover all of this. The Linux desktops I use is Openbox-LXDE or Openbox. Note Openbox is not a complete desktop but a window manager. Additional programs are required. They must be set up individually. I design these for speed and function. I remove slow and bloated programs. Software and setup: Raspberry Pi Openbox Desktop 2019 Setting up Openbox for Raspberry Pi Add Solid State Hard Drive to Raspberry Pi These are mostly sensors connected through the I2C protocol. While digital themselves, they can measure analog sensors. I programmed the above Arduino controller to operate as an I2C slave device.

We will use a common PC printer port to learn basic Python and electronics interfacing. Starting with routines I wrote to aid students; I'd advise walking through this in sequence. Have fun, and send comments or corrections to lewis@bvu.net. Connecting a PC Printer Port to Electronics with Python is closely related to Raspberry Pi. It, too, is a nearly identical Linux system but differs in being designed to use a hardware printer port as I-O to connect electronics projects. The projects here, too, are in Python and, with modifications, will work on Raspberry Pi and vise-versa. It differs in I never bothered to set up the I2C interface found in Raspberry Pi; instead interfaced an Arduino to better handle low-level electronics.
