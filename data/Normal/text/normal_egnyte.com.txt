Egnyte’s features have saved us from confidential data walking out the door.”Matt BirkCIO, GBBN Architects Read Case Study “Egnyte helps with regulatory requirements, especially for startup companies who might not have a big technology budget to start with. I'm excited to leverage more of the security features, more of the integrations with other applications. I think Egnyte has been a great solution for us.”Heather WolffVP, Clinical Development Operations, Decibel Therapeutics Read Case Study “With Egnyte we can share with our subcontractors for just the duration of the project. That gives us a lot of control and the confidence to know we can protect our clients’ sensitive information.”Rob SloyerVP of Innovation and Strategic Services, KAST Construction Read Case Study “Egnyte's product roadmap and commitment to healthcare and biotech has allowed it to remain in lock step and developing in parallel to each and every one of our biotech companies.”John KeiltyVenture Partner, Third Rock Ventures Read Case Study "By implementing Egnyte, we found that the mobile capabilities that we could extend into a jobsite made us more productive and efficient because we didn’t have people going back to the trailers to access the desktop computers in order to access the files they needed."Mark BryantCIO, PCL Construction Read Case Study "The cloud provided easy file sharing and access, but only when there was a strong Internet connection. For our needs, the cloud was not enough. The combination of local + cloud gave us the anytime access to our large files."Patrick HindallCIO, Fulton Homes Read Case Study “We wanted our field offices to work fairly independently but still gain visibility in a simple-to-implement way, which Egnyte does.”Chip TemmCTO, Tetra Tech Read Case Study “All the files for a project can be stored together, in one place, providing a comprehensive view and enabling the creative team to easily find what they need.”Elizabeth AmoroseSenior Partner, ThinkSo Read Case Study “Egnyte was unique compared to the competition. In particular, we liked that we didn’t have to buy a third party product to do the synchronization. Once we saw Egnyte and the synchronization tools it provided we were really excited as that’s a huge differentiator. Also the integration with active directory was a big win for us.”Jim PuernerCIO, Tutor Perini Corporation Read Case Study “Egnyte is integral to our ability to automate much of our data management, which has made the often complex process of working with external partners much smoother, more reliable, and more efficient.”Dr. Rebecca CarazzaHead of Information Systems, Nimbus Therapeutics Read Case Study “It was shocking how good Egnyte was at picking up where we had data that needed controlled access, such as PII.”Michael PetersenSenior Information Systems Security Analyst, S&ME Read Case Study “The benefits of Egnyte have touched our entire organization, from tremendous cost and time efficiencies, to creating a smarter workflow for multiple teams involved in a variety of complex projects.”Greg DasherDirector of Technology and Innovation, Balfour Beatty Read Case Study "Egnyte’s hybrid deployment provides everything our business needs; it’s easy to use, secure, and allows us to deliver high quality projects quicker than before at a competitive cost."Kevin McDonaldHead of IT, Bowmer & Kirkland Read Case Study “With Egnyte, our people in the field can now edit a file and sync it, then provide everyone on the team with instant access to the most up-to-date documents and plans.”Joe TanDirector of IT, DEVCON Read Case Study "It used to take hours to provision an FTP site and IT used to be the bottleneck. Now we have a project structure up in minutes and users can initiate collaboration immediately with partners without compromising security."Randy K. LessorDirector of IT, PC Construction Read Case Study “Everyone needs to be working from the same latest version of files. The Egnyte and Procore integration makes that happen.”Arthur ReedNetwork Administrator, Barnhill Contracting Company Read Case Study Speak with an Egnyte Product Specialist Chat Now!
