Learn More Powered by Trust.Reviews FAQ ask us anything what kind of classes do you offer? We provide private 1-on-1 sessions with our expert online and In-person tutors, delivering customized support and guidance for each student. Our classes come at reasonable prices, understanding the importance of keeping costs down, especially for students who may benefit from multiple sessions. Additionally, we offer homeschooling with state-certified teachers well-versed in real-world curricula, ensuring a quality education. All our tutors undergo extensive background screening and rigorous vetting. Tutoring Costs While recognizing your child’s need for support, budget considerations become crucial in contemplating tutoring. A primary worry for parents considering a tutor is determining the right financial commitment, which proves challenging given the significant fluctuations in tutoring costs.In the world of in-person tutoring, pricing is subject to diverse factors, similar to any market. For instance, residing in a bustling city may result in higher tutoring costs due to adjustments for the elevated cost of living, insurance, gas prices, traffic, and other variables.In contrast, online tutoring emerges as a more cost-effective option, maintaining or even surpassing student performance without the added dynamics of household interactions. Do you Support IEP and ADHD Students? Kids on the Yard strives to support students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and those with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). When considering a tutoring service, it’s advisable to inquire about their ability and experience in accommodating IEP and ADHD students. Reputable tutoring services often have specialized programs, trained tutors, or resources to cater to the unique learning needs of such students. What do parents need to know about finding a tutor? The quest for a tutor comes with its challenges. Relying on word of mouth is key for independent tutors, but opting for an online tutoring company introduces the benefits of online reviews. Parents should emphasize a tutor’s experience, state certification, expertise, education, and personality. Ultimately, customer reviews offer valuable insights into a tutor’s effectiveness.Explore our articles on discovering the ideal tutor or gaining insights into what parents should know for each grade level. What advantages do Kids on the Yard company have over independent tutors? Relying on a well-established tutoring company offers the confidence of reputation protection, extensive resources, and the ability to provide guarantees and resolve customer service issues in favor of the customer. Independent tutors may prioritize their own interests, potentially leading to a suboptimal experience. Moreover, tutoring companies excel in the rigorous vetting of their tutors to ensure your child’s safety. What does research show about the effectiveness of online tutoring? The question of whether online tutoring can establish a meaningful one-on-one connection for successful learning is natural. It’s a question we’ve explored as well. Research strongly supports the effectiveness of online tutoring, aiding students in understanding new material, improving test scores, and building academic confidence. Harvard research and conclusions from the Fordham Institute underscore the significant benefits online tutoring brings to a child’s educational performance, socio-economic skills, and overall well-being. We are ardent believers that revealing the tremendous potential in every student goes beyond changing a life; it’s a permanent metamorphosis that equips them with tools to progress and contribute enduring value to the world. Establishing an elite and meaningful on-demand learning solutions platform involves uniting dedicated individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and expertise, all driven by a love for children and a shared dedication to supporting families. Unlocking potential since 2014 98% of our students see grade-level growth within 4-6 months.
