A Dev Team BlueprintOctober, 2023It's possible that your organization needs to scramble. Perhaps strategy takes a sudden left turn. It's crunch time and you are a part of making it happen.

This project makes use of NJS (which allows for extending NGINX with JavaScript) to integrate an ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) client into NGINX itself. This client communicates with ACME services like Let's Encrypt to manage SSL/TLS certificates automatically on your NGINX server.

This seemed odd to me, given my eligibility for over 30 years and that it is supposedly a random process. It was something I'd mention here and there as friends and colleagues received their summons, but always with a little superstitious hesitation. Lo and behold, a summons arrived in the mail in February 2023, with an April appearance date. I had just started a new job, and I was imagining things would be in full swing come April, so I chose to use my onSt Lucia Trip RecapJune, 2023Marina, Naomi, and I decided last April to book a trip to St Lucia. When we were deciding where to go, we didn't know we wanted to visit St Lucia specifically, but we did know we wanted a Caribbean vacation. After doing a bit of internet research (e.g. googling "how to select a caribbean island") as well as looking at flight times to each, St Lucia came out on top for us -- it's a very nature-oriented country and is not terribly difficult to get to. It ended up being a great decision.

So here we are. 1980 - Logo (Turtle Graphics) My earliest computer programming memory was from a computer lab with Apple ][ computers in some school at night when I was 6 years old. I was there for a computer class (I can't remember the lead-in to that), and was blown away by being able to type things and have the computer draw what I asked it to. I learned the 'repeat' command either this tiNice backup solution for PFSense => TrueNASJanuary, 2023For the last couple of weeks, I've been nerding out on some home networking stuff.

Part of their interface philosophy is the extreme consistency within the Ableton-provided devices. This allows for a deeply opinionated model for user experience, since many basic constraints like "device height" are controlled. This allowed Ableton to make the decision to devote a slim portion of the bottom of the interface window to present a track's devices. This component scrolls horizontally to display more than a screen's width of deviceBringing Customer Focus to Your Engineering TeamDecember, 2022In my experience, one attribute that makes a great software engineering team is their level of customer focus. By customer focus, I mean understanding their customer's needs and placing that front and center in decision making. It's critical for a team to understand that the only reason they exist is because their customers find value in the product or service they are offering. Without the deep understanding of that customer that comes from direct engagement with the customer, the team will likely impede tPerpetual StorageNovember, 2022Where does the data go? Where does it go after you die, after the app company folds, after the powers of the world shift? Your phone is a single generation of a very long line of obsolete devices.

I managed to do both during my three months of funemployment, landing a job at Stripe in the Atlas team in May. I was laid off in November 2022, along with most people who were hired during this time.

I joined probably past the true magical era, and was hired in Yahoo!'s first hyper-growth, bulking-out phase (empno 850) at the beginning of 1999. What made it special? We were inventing how internet-connected distributed apps can work at scale (well, one way!). Nobody had ever solved problems like these before, and Yahoo! made some very smart decisions along the way.

I wrote this post to help parents help their kids survive to adulthood, and not wrapped in a cocoon locked in the house. Give tTapPanVerb - A Reverb + Delay Tap Field + Feedback EffectMay, 2022Last week I had an idea for an effect. I was thinking that a reverb effect should give you control over the pan position of the reverb at a given time after the initial impulse enters the reverb. This could make for some neat movement, since it's not just panning the whole reverb signal -- each moment of the reverb's tail has its designated pan position. After a walk through my current reverb plugins, I decided that I needed to build this if I wanted to hear it. My first attempt was to mock up the idea withTop Things I Wish Were More Clear In Max/MSPApril, 2022I really enjoy working in Max/MSP, especially on Max For Live devices. This is something that sets Ableton Live apart from other DAWs, and really speaks to the Art+Science part of me. I didn't always enjoy working in Max. As a beginner, it all seems so opaque, and others' patches just seem to magically work. But I've worked with computers for long enough to know that when anything feels like magic, I just need to learn more about it. This post exists to help others get over the hump of feeling comfortable aAutomation MathApril, 2022tl;dr If you just want to install it, then head over to the GitHub project page for download links and instructions. Context In Ableton Live, once you assign an automation source to a control, you cannot assign additional automation sources for that control. There are situations where it would be nice to have two sources for one parameter, for instance an LFO at a vibrato frequency modulating filter cutoff, while larger manual filter cutoff moves are provided by a MIDI control surface. When combining signalKnobbler - The Pursuit of an Auto-Labeling Control Surface for Ableton LiveMarch, 2022I'm a big fan of purposeful physical interfaces to computer interfaces for the same reason why I'm a big fan of fully keyboard-controllable apps (bonus points for modal interfaces and a bias for the home row â€“ 'vi' for the win!). When we can use our whole hands, including fingers, we are easily an order of magnitude more productive compared with the single point and click nature of using a mouse or touchpad. I'd wager it's more like two orders of magnitude in terms of real value, given the much lower frictiConsolidate and Loop in Ableton LiveMarch, 2022I'm an efficiency freak. In either my personal or professional life, I'm always looking for ways to eliminate steps in a process, especially if those steps are ones that a person has to take. Sometimes, process changes are big and fundamental and sometimes they are micro-efficiencies. A micro-efficiency may save 2 seconds of waiting time, or eliminate one mouse click. If that savings happens frequently, then the investment in finding the efficiency can pay off. Another advantage of finding micro-efficiencieUsing Terminal vim as an External Editor on MacMarch, 2022If you're reading this, then please allow me to welcome you -- a fellow person of specific needs and preferences! It has bothered me several times in the past that I can't use my text editor of choice everywhere I can edit text. There is an insect brain muscle memory that comes from being a long-time vim user. For example, I regularly find myself resorting to vim commands/shortcuts in places like GMail. I think it's just my body trying to get me back to using mutt to read email again. Regardless, this isn'tAccess Virus and MeFebruary, 2022The Access Virus is a music synthesizer that was first sold around 1997. It was one of the first "virtual analog" synths, which means that it uses computer code that simulates the behavior of analog circuits, rather than using computer code to play back samples. This approach brought more liveliness to its sounds compared with other synths of the time, and this appealed to a lot of different kinds of musicians. The Virus was a staple of many studios in the late 90s and through the 2010s, with people like HaMaking 'git diff' Work For .amxdFebruary, 2022Here's a quick tip if you're using git for revision control in developing Max/MSP or Max For Live devices.

I finally made time to learn enough Max for Live to do this in the way that I always wanted. The prior version worked fine, but changing sounds was very cumbersome, requiring updating the sample loaded into 8 Simpler devices. This new version uses a single sample "drop zone", and offers some nice usability and capability improvements.

It's a silly picture that doesn't do the idea justice. This document is intended to better explain the benefits of Pair Programming and different styles of practicing it. Benefits Before we get into the ways that pair programming can be done, let's first explore the role of collaboration in software development.

This allows for easy creation of very complex patterns that, due to their nature in following a scaled pattern, tend to be pleasant to listen to and can inspire creativity you didn't know you had. Here is an example of a song I put together: What is a fractal MIDI note echo effect you ask? Well, it's a device that sends note echoes, but each echo follows the rules of fractals.

The sun shining through the blinds was projecting an unmistakable circle on the opposite wall. I knew that this was an actual projection of the sun, rather than just a diffuse circle of light. I watched it for a while, then shot this time-lapse of the sun setting through some branches of the tree. Because of how the pinhole camera works, the sun appears to be going up, but that is just because a lens or pinhole will flip the image. Here iThe Best Ways To Run a Short Script in a ContainerMay, 2021Gone are the days of managing installed versions of interpreters (Ruby, Javascript/Node.js, Python, ...), compilers, servers, databases, and caches on your local machine.

Being able to gracefully network between containers, mount file systems between containers and the host machine, bring up entire config-managed collections of services wPinhole Camera / Phone CameraMay, 2021Since the 1600s, people have experimented with light-proof rooms, chambers, or boxes with a small hole in one side, known as a Camera Obscura. With the advent of photographic film or paper, this idea evolved into the Pinhole Camera -- a light-proof box with a tiny hole on one end, and a photo-sensitive material at the other. The hole is uncovered for a period of time, and the light from outside is focused by the tiny hole on the material on the other end of the box. The hole is then covered, and the photo-sKimchi With CarrotsApril, 2021I love kimchi! It's sauerkraut's Korean cousin and is useful in many dishes as a side. I'll eat it with a sausage on a tortilla with mayo and mustard for lunch, or put on top of an aloo parata with some sour cream. Add to fried rice for a spicy and sour kick, or use it to elevate eggs and potatoes. It's satisfying to make, as it self-fermets on the counter from a lovely spicy vegetable melange into a delicious and complex spicy sour fiesta. It keeps super well in the fridge, so it can always be there for yoHome Time Machine / NAS With a Raspberry PiApril, 2021The Problem I've got a few computers at home and a few random external hard drives that sometimes back up those computers. Since some are laptops, I need to remember to connect the external drive to them, which of course doesn't always happen. Also, there's no slick way to share files between computers, aside from setting up specific shares on each computer. What I need is a network storage system. Something that's always there, accessible via WiFi, can be used via Time Machine on my Macs, reliable, and mosFeedback FRACK for Ableton LiveMarch, 2021Inspired by Hainbach's video on Pinging, but lacking outboard hardware, I decided to explore creating a feedback device in Ableton Live. Normally, when you want to build a feedback loop in Live, you would use a Return track set up to feed back to itself, either directly by enabling its own send, or via an Audio Track set up to take input from the Return track and sending some of its output back to the Return track. While this does work, it's fairly clumsy since there are multiple tracks involved. Creating aActual Room ReverbMarch, 2021This was some of the most fun I've had with music making recently. After watching this video from the great producer, engineer, and mixer Sylvia Massy where she demonstrates re-amping a synth line to give it power and space, I tried the same thing with one track of the song I was working on at the time, 100 Squares. You can hear the net effect on the arp'd synth line starting at about 1:45. For that one, I connected my bass combo amp to the speaker out on my main audio interface. I put one mic directly in fWhat I Know About Mixing And Mastering Right NowFebruary, 2021I've just learned some things about mastering and I thought I'd write them down. During my last project, I took several recordings I think sound really good in the genre I'm working in (dub-ish techno?) and looked at their waveforms. What struck me is that for the most part, they peak at around -4db. This was a very important piece of information. Looking at my prior work, I had always set the limiter to peak at -1.0db, and my songs always sounded so bassy. If I brought up levels of non-bass instruments to All The Ways Up Mission PeakJanuary, 2021Anyone who knows me reasonably well knows I have a soft spot for Mission Peak. I grew up in Fremont, and begrudgingly hiked up the Peak with my family every so often, complaining the whole time. It was hot. It was dry. I was thirsy. I was tired. Except for the time was a teenager and took a detour around the Hidden Valley area and headed off-trail, straight up the peak face. That was adventure! (not recommended, of course!)

On its surface, availability is a simple measurement to understand or describe -- it's just a measurement of the proportion of time a service is up and running within a given time period. Right? The reality, like with most top-line measurements, is far more nuanced, and without detailed context, the metric actually says nothing.

This post seeks to identify those metrics that lead to the best outcomes for the team, the products they are building, and for the business. We will also look at some "industry standard" metrics and we will see how they can be counterproductive, since they don't actually lead to a stronger team, and are susceptible to being gamed.

The further out a given commitment is made, the more toxic that commitment is to the organization. Your job as the leader or member of a team is to ensure that team is as functional as possible and remains as functional into the future. You can do your part in ensuring the functionality, happiness, and productivity of your team by reshaping your commitments away from far-future due dates.

Not only in our algorithms, but more importantly in how our team gets work done. Efficiency Let's first clarify this concept. What do we mean by 'efficiency' in this context? The simple definition of efficiency is the amount of output for a given amount of input. In the context of a commercial software development team, the input is the amount of time the people in the team give to their jobs, and the output is the amount Systems of Working - The Role of LeadershipAugust, 2019There are as many systems of working as there are development teams. One important dimension in evaluating a system of working is identifying the role of leadership in the team. Here are a few systems of working that you may encounter in the wild: In this corner: Command and Control On one end of the leadership scale is what I call "Command and Control". This is the typical single-leader taskmaster model. In this system of working, there is a fleet of "resources" (they are never referred to as "people") whoHow To InterviewAugust, 2019Interviewing is hard, on both sides. The skills of an interviewer are often overlooked in software development, and people are usually left on their own when it comes time to interview a potential teammate or coworker. This does everyone a disservice. This document outlines a framework and a set of principles to be used when interviewing, hopefully to bring calm, structure, and excellence to the hiring process.' Waiting For a Service to Actually Become Available in docker-composeOctober, 2017If you use docker-compose to run an app, more than likely you use container links in the form of "depends_on:" in your docker-compose.yml, like this: services: api: build: . depends_on: - db ports: - "8080:8080" db: image: postgres:9.6-alpine ports: - "5432:5432" environment: - POSTGRES_USER=user - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass - POSTGRES_DB=db The problem is that your app ("api" in the example above) will start immediately after the command to start "db" and "redis" is invoked.

Maybe dropping something on the floor. Silverware can make some cool sounds. I had my Rode i-XY plugged into my phone. The Rode i-XY is a stereo mic with integrated app. It records with great detail and clarity, and it's pretty straightforward to move recordings to my computer using FTP (though AirDrop would be even easier). As I walked into the kitchen, the sliding door caught my eye.Sound Making vs. Song MakingMay, 2017For me, music-making has two phases -- sound-making and song-making. These are two very different disciplines. Sound-making is fun and spontaneous. Song-making can be those things too, but it also becomes extremely detailed and deliberate as the song inches closer to its final version. Sound-making exists in many forms. It may be a playable instrument sculpted inside of a synthesizer, where sound-generators produce waveforms that are modified and shaped by other processing units. It may be an existing recorVancouver LandingDecember, 2016Harbour AirVancouver Take-OffDecember, 2016Harbour AirLevi's Gran Fondo Panzer - Kruse Ranch RdOctober, 2016Woohoo!

This year was such an experience in learning, growth, and overcoming adversity. The story starts toward the end of last year when I started running with "Club Nina" -- a loosely organized group of about 20 local trail crazies led by the gregarious and motivated Nina G.

I love the creativity of it, the chemistry and process, and of course eating good food. Given the choice, I'd take an environment like "Chopped" over a cookbook any day. Give me a few good ingredients and an empty plate and let's see what happens. Mostly I've been experimenting lately with making Indian food.

Most bikes use a straight 1 1/8" headtube. Nicer frames use a tapered 1 1/8" to 1 1/2" design. The larger diameter is stiffer and provides for a larger bearing surface, so Cannondale wasn't being totally arbitrary with their choice, but it's nonstandard nonetheless. If you're looking for a replacement, there are very few options. I got a 1.On Building Your Security TeamJune, 2014Perhaps your company is at the point in its growth curve where you need a person dedicated to security issues, or perhaps you're looking to reboot your security team because of some of the problems outlined below. What follows are over-generalizations about the best way to build a functional information security team, but that are in line with what I have seen succeed (and fail) in small and large engineering organizations. Note that this is really focused on information security for 'production' systems (tMission Peak Dark DescentJune, 2014It's been a while since I did a night run on Mission Peak.

Bike Upgrade ConfirmationJuly, 2013A report from a week with some awesome upgrades to my bike. I learned a lot about bikes, adjustments, and found some great resources in doing this project.Two Days With a New FriendJuly, 2013After we got home from the Pleasanton Tri For Fun, I was excited to tear into my weekend bike project. I had gotten a new driveline (gears, cranks, shifters, chain etc) for my bike to upgrade what came on the bike originally. I had been planning it out all week, and Saturday was the day that I could execute the plan. A couple of hours into the project, I was working at the bench in the garage when I heard the familiar thrum of a hummingbird nearby. Sure enough, a little grey and green hummingbird was in theTri For Fun - Pleasanton 2013 RecapJuly, 2013It all started in May. Actually, it all started 11 years ago when Arti and I signed up for the 15th annual Tri For Fun in Pleasanton at Shadow Cliffs park. Swimming, biking, and running were all things that I did not do, but we thought this would be fun. Well, Arti did at least. We spent the next several months preparing for this race. There was a 400 yard swim, 11 mile bike ride, and 3.1 mile run. We would go to the community pool in Mountain View two or three times a week and swim a couple of thousand yarOhlone 50K RecapMay, 2013Last October I decided to run the Ohlone Wilderness Trail 50K. Leading up to that decision was a few years of hiking in the East Bay hills, a newfound enjoyment in running, and daily trips to Zombie Runner where I learned about the race. After 6 months of training covering 435 miles and climbing more than 80,000 feet, the race is now in the bag. It wasn't all so easy though. In February I got over-exuberant with my training and ended up with a knee injury that took me off the trails for two weeks. The guys Bike to Work Day RunMay, 2013I chose to celebrate Bike to Work Day by going for a run this morning. My plan was to do the O50K climb up Mission Peak, but turn right at the top of the ridge and visit Mt. Allison before heading back over and down Mission Peak. 9.7 miles, 2750ft climb, 2h05m. There were a few spaces in the Stanford Ave parking lot when I got there at 8am -- I guess the chilly, foggy morning scared a lot of people away. Or maybe the active people were out riding their bikes to work. Anyhow, it seemed like a good day for a Trail Running: What I've Learned So FarMay, 2013Since getting serious about running at the end of 2012 in preparation for the Ohlone Wilderness 50K, I've learned a few things. Here they are: Foam Roller + Stretch Every Day The foam roller is a kind of self-massage that uses your body weight to bear down on your muscles. I'm not sure why or how it works, but there is no doubt that it does work to make tired muscles feel fresh, and to make tight muscles looser. Tight muscles can lead to pain and injury -- my own knee injury in February was due to an overlyOhlone Steep TrainingMay, 2013It's two weeks until O50K, and my training plan calls for shorter runs to taper to the event. Today I chose to start from Ohlone and run up and over Mission Peak then over to the bench at Mt. Allison. It was a total of 9.1 miles with a 2520 foot climb. The route I chose was to go up "Buttburner Hill", which you can get to if you take a hard right turn after first gate after the initial long climb from the Ohlone parking lot. Buttburner Hill is 0.6 miles long and gains 821 feet (27.5% grade). There is 0.2 miLast Long Run Before O50KApril, 2013I got a pretty early start today, getting out of bed at 5:30a to do the last long training run before the big race. Hit the trail at 6:45 with a plan to do the O50K course for 13-ish miles, then turn around and retrace my steps. It was a lovely morning, with cool air and a warm breeze that was a bellwether for the warm day that was to follow. My plan was to take it really easy so that I could cover the full distance without falling apart. The first 4.5 miles up Mission Peak were an exercise in restraint, buSunol Valley Half PipeApril, 201324 miles today starting from Sunol Regional Park -- 12 east, then 12 west. 5600 feet climb, 6 hours.Ed Levin to Sunol and BackMarch, 2013For today's long run, I chose to go from Ed Levin County Park in Milpitas, up to Monument Peak, then north past Mt. Allison, behind Mission Peak, down to Sunol Regional Park, then turn around and run back. 22.5 miles / 5000 ft ascent / 5h20m. Sunol to Rose PeakMarch, 2013I set out today to tackle Rose Peak once again. I hiked it a couple years ago, but haven't done it since I've been running. It behooves me to practice it, since it's 1/3 of the Ohlone 50K. I set out at 9am (dang it DST!) and got to the peak in 2h30m. Took only a little less time to get back to the parking lot. Compared with the last time, I knocked 3 hours off my personal best (har!). Loving Strava's calorie counter (5165kcal)... I could see the Sierras from the summit of Rose Peak. Super clear day! Bring tMonument Peak RunFebruary, 2013Beautiful morning in the East Bay Hills.

My prior biggest run was 18 miles, and have never done any mid-week work. This week I started running an hour each morning three days a week and plan on continuing that to build a solid base. Getting sweaty in the morning has been awesome so far. My outlook through the day is definitely more positive, and I have more energy in the evenings when I get home. The only downside is that I'm sweating until Remote Speakers DIYJanuary, 2013This is a project I've wanted to do since we moved in. With just a few simple parts, I installed independent remote speakers into our dining room. What I wanted was a system that was simple, controllable from an iPhone via AirPlay, and that didn't require going to another room and turning something on before we could listen to music. Here are the parts that will do the job: In-Wall Speakers: Polk RC85i - $150/pr Amplifier: AudioSource AMP-100 - $90 Sound Source: Apple AirPort Express - $100 Speaker Wire: GeBack in the SaddleNovember, 2012With the Ohlone 50k looming in May, I've been inspired to get back out there on foot on the trails. After a few weeks away, this weekend was the time to get back into it. My initial plan was to follow the O50K course up and over Mission Peak then run down to the gate at Calaveras Road and back (about 15 miles total), but at the point where I'd start running toward Calaveras I decided to cut it short. Mimi and Pop are coming into town, and we're going to decorate the tree with them and Kanta. Also I needed tThunderhill 3-Day WeekendNovember, 2012Just got home from three days at Thunderhill Raceway with the GGC BMWWCCA. Friday was an Instructor Training School. The club does this once every couple of years to refresh old instructors skills, and to haze/vet/train new instructors. I was assigned a new recruit (who had more years instructing than me, just with other groups) and my role was to play the "bad student". Andy, the candidate instructor, was a great guy and we got along well all day. I tried hard in the morning to be my best Knucklehead McStu98 Mile Bike WeekNovember, 2012Almost cracked 100 miles on the bike this week. On Sunday, Arti and I went for a 24 mile ride with the Kohlers through Saratoga, through the hills around Quicksilver, then back to their house. Good times, and the ladies showed us up with their hill climbing powers. Obviously it was because of their road bikes, with Sean and I battling friction on our mountain bikes... ;-) Monday and Tuesday I did the usual train commute (6 miles). Wednesday I rode home from work (3 miles in the AM, 28 in the PM, 2 hours). TMountain View to HomeOctober, 2012Took the train up to Stanford today to interview some promising college Grads.

Here's why... owl / math owlOctober, 2012Ed Levin to Mission Peak and BackOctober, 2012I hit the trail at 8am today in Ed Levin County Park. It was a beautiful, cool, sunny morning ... mid-50s. It was an ideal day out there today -- warm sun and cool breeze. I covered 16 miles, 4200 ft elevation gain, in 3h40m. Groupon to Home RideOctober, 2012I decided to ride my bike home from work today. Ended up taking about 2.5 hours, and covered 27 miles, most of it on the Bay Trail and Guadalupe River Trail. Stanford Ave - MP - Calaveras Rd - MP - Stanford AveSeptember, 201218 miles / 6000 ft climb today up and over MP to Calaveras road and back. Now soaking in cold tub. Ahhhhhhhh..... Took the Ohlone 50K "way" up to the peak, then down to high-five the gate at Calaveras Road. Retraced steps FTW.Up and Over Black MountainSeptember, 2012Had a nice hike/run today from Rhus Ridge, up and over Black Mountain and down the Indian Creek Trail a bit. Distance was 14 miles, 5000 feet total ascent, and took 2h50m. Mission Peak MTBSeptember, 2012Rode up Mission Peak today with Sean Kohler. I was expecting it to be harder than it was, but it was still a doozie. We did about 10 miles total, 2700 feet elevation gain. The first stretch up the peak was 2.8 miles and 1750 feet gain -- unrelentingly steep. From there we went around the back of the peak and up to Mt. Allison, then came back and went down the Grove Trail past the farmhouse (sweet technical section!) and rejoined the main trail. I'm really happy we did it!

We bought the car new, and it has about 90K miles on it now. Overall, it's been a great car and still looks and drives very nicely. I've noticed though over the past year or so that it feels a bit "wallowy" in some situations. Usually I felt that in in sweeping turns with some undulations -- the car felt like it was moving around more than it should, and felt less stable than it should. Sounds like the shocks are done! Rio Vista's Perpetual StormApril, 2012In the weather app I use on my phone, there is a map view with configurable overlays. One of the most useful is the Doppler Radar overlay, which usually shows precipitation level on a colorful scale.\n\nOne thing I've noticed on the radar overlay is that there is an area in the north bay, near Fairfield and Rio Vista that appears to always have storm-level activity over it. DIY: iPhone MacroApril, 2012It's easy to capture amazing close-up photos with your smartphone.

Allison, and Monument Peak every possible way now. Looking at Google Earth and talking with Arti, I decided to see how to get up Black Mountain. It's a 2800 foot peak to the west of Mountain View and Los Altos. Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve is the closest park, and provides a great route up. Laguna with PDCMarch, 2012Beautiful day today at Laguna. Mid-50s, partly cloudy, snow-capped peaks in the distance, dry track. I decided before this event that I'd push the car a little harder than normal -- so there's a bit more countersteering in this video than others. \n\nManaged to pull out a couple 1:46 laps (a new personal best), then had a front swaybar bracket break at the end of this session. I removed the swaybar and went out again -- the car was surprisingly well behaved, but a few seconds slower.\n\nE36 M3 daily driver, 245/40-17 R-888s, PF-01 pads (like!)

Over the years I've worked out a very efficient way of going through the tons of email I receive, never missing an important message, and never having an oppressive number of unread messages.

The CCC is an all-day high performance driving school, with a focus on real-world skills. It's also a prerequisite for the club's driving schools held at local racetracks like Laguna Seca or Infineon Raceway.

Please bear with my story below to understand my suggestions: This all started when I realized Protect Your Git Repo With a Test HookApril, 2011We have a situation at work where we're using a git repository as a data source. The quality/correctness of the files checked in to this repo is critical to the operation of a larger and very important system. To help ward off mistakes, we built a series of unit tests using Test::Unit::TestCase, and hooked it into our Rakefile so that before committing a change we (usually) run "rake test" and let the automated tests do their thing. It's so cool that it can do over 1000 checks in a small fraction of a seconAlternative Single Table Inheritance for RailsApril, 2011A case came up in doing a revamp on this site's software where I wanted to use one table to store metadata for "entries" (blog posts, flickr photo sets, tweets, etc) but wanted a more specialized class to be constructed when reading or writing records to this table to correspond with the particular source type. Rails provides a simple single-table inheritance capability by using a column called "type". When a record is read in, the value of the type column is used to instantiate an object of that type.

She was getting really good on the monkey bars -- and I thought I could show her a couple things. As soon as I grabbed the bar and my feet left the pavement I realized that I was not prepared to haul quite this much weight around. I could barely hold on to the bar!

Going from the Stanford Ave parking lot up the Peak Trail is just under 3 miles and the elevation gain is just over 2,000 feet. My goal was to do this in an hour, but I finished it in 1:04:20 without cutting any swithbacks or taking other shortcuts. Close enough where next time I think I can do it.

I've been up Mission Peak a bunch of times, and I've always been curious about the the transmission antennas on the peaks to the south. In looking at the map, I knew that the peaks had names -- Mt. Allison and Monument Peak. Mt. Allison is 200 feet higher than Mission Peak. From the Google Maps satellite view, I could see that there were trails on these other peaks. So I set out to make a route. This morning, I parked at Ed R.

We really want to be good and do the right thing. One thing that helps to guide us through life are our beliefs: Who is in charge? What does this all mean? Why are we here? It is a faith in our own answers to these questions that guides us through decisions in what to do with our life. It also acts as a filter on our experiences that colors our perception of those experiences. We're stubborn creatures, and we're particularly good at attributing the cause of an eTip TipsJanuary, 2010Divide By Six This one is simple, but I'm surprised that not enough people know it. My tip secret to divide the bill total by six. Others use shortcuts like "twice tax", but that works out to over 18% now. Still a decent baseline to round up or down from. Another shortcut is "divide by ten then add half again". Divide by six is equivalent to 16.6%. Let's do a few tests to see what is easiest... The bill is $24.52. Divide by six gives you $4 pretty quickly. Divide by ten and half again is $2.45 then what's h25 Hours of ThunderhillDecember, 2009Thanksgiving photosNovember, 20090035-CRW_1580, originally uploaded by thenobot.

I had never used it before, and am starting to learn why it has been able to grow as quickly as it has -- it's just damn cool in a lot of ways. One technique we used a lot in my previous company was to allocate a column in a database to be a "catch-all" for various attributes, in the form of a serialized hash. The advantage here is that if we want to add an attribute to a table, we would not need to alter the table unless we absolutely had to Sluggy!March, 2009Marina helped me get our vegetable garden beds ready for spring this past weekend.

Anyone with an SCCA racing license and a race-ready car could just show up and enjoy a full day of driving, err I mean testing. This was also going to be the first time we tried out doing the "arrive and drive" thing with Evil Genius Racing. We pay them to house, transport, and prep the car, and we just get to show up and get in! Fish and Justin of Evil Genius had the car all set for us when we arrived a bit after 9am.

Anyone who knows me well knows that I am motivated by my dreams (ref: Marina, etc) -- or at least I talk about being motivated by them more than most people I know.

My mission was to kill the The Bucket Analogy for Photo ExposuresDecember, 2008There are three primary aspects to a photographic exposure: How sensitive is the recording material? How bright is the light contacting the recording material? How long is the recording material exposed to the light? I've found it useful to map the task of getting the "right" exposure to the act of filling a bucket (the film or digital sensor) with water (light) through a hose (the camera and lens). The sensitivity of the recording material (measured in ISO) is akin to the size of the bucket. A smaller buckOne-Line Javascript TemplatesDecember, 2008I came up with this today. Maybe it's not original, but I think it's pretty cool. The overall concept is that there is a DOM node that holds an output template. A template is defined as some HTML that contains some strings to be replaced. In this case, the "to be replaced" strings look like @this@. The template processing function takes a key:value map and a handle to the template element as arguments. The keys in the map are matched with the string between the @at-signs@. The whole @mess@ is replaced with Double Standard?October, 2008(sent to me by a friend) With the election in just a few weeks, here are some interesting questions to consider: What if John McCain were a former president of the Harvard Law Review?

This is a mandatory step to being able to compete in SCCA road races for those who don't already have a racing license with an accepted organization. It's a three day school, offering at least two hours of track time per day. On the last day of the school, the "final exam" is in the form of two races with our fellow students.

Since the original WRT-54 firmware was Linux based, Linksys had to release the source code to it, which spawned lots of variants offering better feature sets.

Here's the story: About a year ago, I had an idea for a web application that was different from any other web application. In short, it allows its user to view information from the future, present, and past in a new and different way. It can help to bring people together, as well as bring more understanding to where we came from. Sounds like a big idea right? Well I think it is. So I worked on this idea for about a month. I took some time off of work and built a prGoodbye Yahoo!, Hello Pinger!January, 2007I start my new job this coming Monday! Pinger was started by Joe Sipher and Greg Woock, who were instrumental in the success of Palm and Handspring. They had an idea for a new mode of communication that filled the space between having a phone conversation and sending an email. Pinger merges the strengths of both -- the speed and content of a voice message, but with the convenience features of an email. To send a Pinger message, you simply dial the special "send" phone number, say the name of the person in yMiata Blog StartedJanuary, 2007I've started a new blog to chronicle the birth and life of a little racecar that Derek and I are building. It's called "spec.this.miata " (http://specthismiata.com/). We're building a Spec Miata, which is basically a Miata with a hardtop, rollcage, and improved suspension. We'll update the blog whenever we do something to or with the car. It's on track to go to TC Design on January 8 so that Tony can fabricate a roll cage and seat brackets.

I took the opportunity to do a few small things to the Miata race-car-in-progress. After an hour, I came back inside because I knew she'd be waking up soon. A bit later, I heard her stirring. She normally will stand up in her crib, hands on the railing, and bounce up and down chanting "maMA maMA maMA maMA" or "daDA daDA daDA daDA" (which is naturally my favorite). "daDA! daDA! daDA!"

It is an endurance race where teams race continuously from 11am on Saturday until noon on Sunday. The team that completes the most laps during that time is the winner. I got involved with this pretty much by luck. It started when I read an article that announced Car & Driver and BMW of North America would be campaigning two 335d's at the race.

Mark has three rules about who is allowed to drive with his group: The person must have 10 days of on-track experience, with at least a few of them "signed off" driving solo.

Previously, there was a feed for stories and a feed for pictures. With Marina, driving events, the DV Cam, our Macs, and iMovie HD, we've been making and sharing lots of videos. I thought about making a feed just for videos, but that seemed like a worse solution than just rolling a single feed. So from now going forward, there is just a single feed from the Nobot. The old photos feed will still work for a longPotty Time, ExcellentFebruary, 2006Zack and I decided early on that when Marina could walk and communicate, she should also be potty trained. We couldn't see ourselves changing the diaper of a two year old after being instructed by her to do so. Hence, our potty journey began. I had talked with my mom about how she potty trained my brother and I. She told me she would hold us over the toilet when she thought we had to go and by the time we were about a year old, we would take ourselves to the bathroom. Simple as that.

The curd is placed in a cheesecloth and run under water, then pressed under a heavy weight to press out the water. You can buy it in an Indian market in slabs resembling Tofu. Paneer tastes a bit like fresh mozarella cheese, albeit less fatty and more mild. Oftentimes, Arti's mom will make a really tasty dish with Paneer, red bell peppers, and onions in a very rich and spicy creNew TricksFebruary, 2006It's been a while since I've written anything here. I've mostly been consumed with day-to-day stuff: Marina, Arti, work, projects. I thought it would be good to write down what Marina has been up to in the past month or so. As the video shows, Marina is now really really good at rolling herself onto her belly. She did it for the first time maybe three weeks ago, but only did it once. Then days passed, and she did it twice. There was a 1+ week lull of any rolling activity, then she seemed to just get it. NowThe Story of MarinaOctober, 2005Shortly after we returned from our Christmas/New Years trip to the Galapagos, Arti knew she was pregnant. A home pregnancy test and a trip to the doctor confirmed this. This was great news, since we had decided to take the next step and "pulled the goalie" a few months back. That was cool -- a baby conceived in the Land of Darwin, a group of islands on the equator and full of unique animals. After a few weeks, we had an appointment with our midwife for our first ultrasound. Looking at that tiny, rasberry siWowsers! Ground Control Coilover Kit Rules!August, 2005During last weekend's BMW CCA Car Control Clinic, I realized that the BMW tuned the E46 M3 for understeer. I think their intention was safety -- with so much power available, it's all to easy for a beligerent, leadfooted driver to spin the car exiting a corner. By making the front tires lose traction first, I think BMW was trying to avoid the M3 having a reputation as a car that is hard to control. Plowing around the different exercises at the Car Control Clinic wasn't as fun this time as last year in my olKite Aerial Photography, Experiment IFebruary, 2005It all started when I saw these photos that George R. Lawrence took of San Francisco right after the 1906 earthquake. He had been working on using kites as aerial photography platforms, and had nearly perfected his technique when the quake hit. I had run across some other sites online where people had used kites and weather balloons as photographic platforms, and it really seemed like fun.

CSS properties are given the same treatment, since they look like C labels (e.g. "margin-right:1em;"). i like everything about cindent, except for the two cases above. for the work i'Say Hello to My Little FriendFebruary, 2005Well, there it is sunning itself up in the upper-right corner of that kidney-shaped pool.

All in all it was a fun project, with very little monotony or frustration over the project. This is a simple platform bed. The platform is made from 1/2" plywood, and has no heavy bracing to counteract flex caused by a load (ahem -- about those 20 lbs I've gained since getting married...). The secret of this bed is the bowing of the "slats".

It's a smaller companion to the coffee table I made about 4 months ago. The fun parts took about a day -- making the design (the funnest part), buying the wood, then building the structure. I learned from the coffee table that a table like this needs two kinds of braces between each leg -- the "shelf", and a crossmember that sits just below the table top.
