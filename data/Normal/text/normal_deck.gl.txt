We already offer a catalog of proven layers and we have many more in the works.High-Precision Computations in the GPUBy emulating 64 bit floating point computations in the GPU, deck.gl renders datasets with unparalleled accuracy and performance.React Friendlydeck.gl APIs are designed to reflect the reactive programming paradigm. Whether using Vanilla JS or the React interface, it can handle efficient WebGL rendering under heavy data load.Integration with Base Map ProvidersWhile deck.gl works standalone without a base map, it plays nicely with your favorite base map providers such as Google Maps, Mapbox, ArcGIS and more. Where the base map library permits, deck.gl may interleave with 3D map layers to create seamless visualizations.ResourcesAPI ReferenceStarter templatesPlaygroundCodepen demosOther vis.gl Librariesluma.glloaders.glreact-map-glnebula.glMoreSlack workspacevis.gl blog on MediumGitHubCopyright Â© 2024 OpenJS Foundation
