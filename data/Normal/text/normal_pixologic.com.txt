The latest version features an updated Anchors Brush system which provides an intuitive way to deform meshes by applying anchors onto a mesh while allowing for actions to be performed. The Knife Brushes gain increased design dexterity with a Split to Parts feature set allowing parts to be cut off and retained. Insert Mesh brushes are now compatible with Stroke menu options providing a wild range of visual possibilities. Designing surface details and adding secondary elements to models is now more easily achieved with the Repeat to Similar functionality, and the new DragStamp stroke option helps to advance surface details while buttons like Crease UnMasked and Uncrease UnMasked set the stage for dynamic edge control. The Gizmo and Transpose functions include topology masking for both tools while allowing snapping on perfectly masked areas. The Gizmo is now capable of snapping to the center of masked regions, and the addition of Cinema 4D noises provide robust methods for detailing assets. ZBrush provides access to diverse workflows and limitless creative possibilities.Anchor BrushGizmo/Transpose MaskingC4D NoisesRepeat to SimilarGrow/Shrink MaskKnife Brush Split to PartsDragStampCrease Unmasked/Uncrease UnmaskedView All FeaturesArtist: Stephen DavidianZBrushBorn in ClayZBrush sets the industry standard for digital sculpting and painting.

The powerful systems inside of ZBrush are designed to eliminate the constraints of traditional modeling and allow you to create freely, just as you would with clay. When you’re ready to move your 3D sculpt into a pipeline for animation, rendering or 3D printing, the tools to do so are at hand.

This offers significant advantages compared to a standard workflow. The resolution of the texture map does not need to be decided in advance. You have the freedom to visualize, explore and create textures in 3D, and in real time.PolyPaintUV MasterSpotlightAdvanced FeaturesArtist: Vahid AhmadiZBrushReady, Set, RenderWhether you are using ZBrush by itself as an illustration tool or as part of a production pipeline for animation, you will at some point want to show your work to others.
