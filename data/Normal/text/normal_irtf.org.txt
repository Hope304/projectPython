Overview The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) focuses on longer term research issues related to the Internet while the parallel organization, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), focuses on the shorter term issues of engineering and standards making. The IRTF is comprised of a number of focused and long-term Research Groups. These groups work on topics related to Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology. Research Groups have the stable long-term membership needed to promote the development of research collaboration and teamwork in exploring research issues. Participation is by individual contributors, rather than by representatives of organizations. The IRTF also organises the ACM/IRTF Applied Networking Research Workshop and the Applied Networking Research Prize to encourage collaboration between the academic research world and the Internet standards community. The IRTF also makes available a number of travel grants and fee waivers to support PhD students, early career researchers, and under-represented groups to attend research group meeting, workshops, and other IRTF-related events. Research Groups These 15 Research Groups are currently chartered or proposed for chartering: CFRG Crypto Forum Research Group COINRG Computation in the Network Research Group DINRG Decentralization of the Internet Research Group GAIA Global Access to the Internet for All Research Group HRPC Human Rights Protocol Considerations Research Group ICCRG Internet Congestion Control Research Group ICNRG Information-Centric Networking Research Group MAPRG Measurement and Analysis for Protocols Research Group NMRG Network Management Research Group PANRG Path Aware Networking Research Group PEARG Privacy Enhancements and Assessments Research Group QIRG Quantum Internet Research Group RASPRG Research and Analysis of Standard-Setting Processes Research Group T2TRG Thing-to-Thing Research Group UFMRG Usable Formal Methods Proposed Research Group More Information RFC 7418 gives an IRTF Primer for IETF Participants. It provides a high-level description of issues for IETF participants to consider when bringing proposals for new research groups into the IRTF, and emphasizes differences in expectations between the two organizations. The IRTF is managed by the IRTF Chair in consultation with the Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG). The IRSG membership includes the IRTF Chair, the chairs of the various Research Groups, and other individuals (“members at large”) from the research community selected by the IRTF Chair. The governance and operation of the IRTF is described by various RFCs and other policy documents including Intellectual Property Rights disclosure rules. The IETF’s Anti-Harassment Policy and Privacy Policy also apply to the IRTF. The irtf-announce@irtf.org mailing list is a low-volume announcement mailing list for Research Group creations and conclusions, IRTF RFC publication, etc. The irtf-discuss@irtf.org mailing list is the main discussion list for general IRTF topics. A wiki with more information about the IRTF is here. Latest News ANRW’24 Call for Papers The Applied Networking Research Workshop 2024 is now accepting paper submissions.
