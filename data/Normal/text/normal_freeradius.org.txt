It powers most major Internet Service Providers and Telecommunications companies world-wide and is one of the key technologies behind eduroam, the international Wi-Fi education roaming service. It is the RADIUS server used by all Cloud Identity providers and is embedded in products from network equipment vendors and token card manufacturers. The FreeRADIUS product suite includes a server, radius client, development libraries, and numerous additional RADIUS and IP address-related utilities. It is fundamental to the working of the Internet around the world, and is responsible for authenticating hundreds of millions of users every day. Internet Service Providers AAA for millions of subscribers. Infinitely flexible policy language. Internet Service Providers FreeRADIUS authenticates users and tracks accounting data for millions of DSL connections and phones every day. Enterprise Networks Global AAA servers.

View full release notes This is the FreeRADIUS project, the open source implementation of RADIUS, an IETF protocol for AAA (Authorisation, Authentication, and Accounting). The FreeRADIUS project maintains the following components: a multi protocol policy server (radiusd) that implements RADIUS, DHCP, BFD, and ARP; a BSD licensed RADIUS client library; a RADIUS PAM library; and an Apache RADIUS module. We provide a step-by-step guide to radiusd -X. The guide breaks down the different pieces of the debug output, and explains what they mean. Often you can just look for ERROR or WARNING to solve many problems. FreeRADIUS is responsible for authenticating one third of all users on the Internet.
