[in] the form of a demented military control room, as imagined by gamers hopped up on Adderall and taurine and executed by crafty preschoolers.” The piece, which was on view at New York’s Gladstone Gallery in a show that closed this past week, “stages a paradoxical confrontation between excess and impoverishment” that is also “colored by déjà vu,” recalling Hirschhorn’s Iraq War–era exhibition “Superficial Engagement,” presented at Gladstone in 2006. This week, Artforum revisits David Joselit’s review of that exhibition and Hirschhorn’s contemporaneous “Utopia, Utopia = One World, One War, One Army, One Dress” at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, published in the magazine’s March 2006 issue. —The editors PMC Logo Most Popular 1.
