BootsnAll - Independent Travel Community for Indie TravelArticlesFeaturedAbout UsFlightsWelcome to BootsnAllGuidance for the Road AheadSince 1999, BootsnAll has helped you better understand yourself and others by encouraging you to leave home to experience the world firsthand.We call this Independent Travel or today’s Covid world, Independent Exploration…which is a departure from routine – an opportunity to learn, have fun and embrace life in novel environments and cultures, even in your own city/location. We better understand ourselves and others when we leave home to experience the world firsthand. BootsnAll cultivates this understanding and human condition and values interactions over transactions and private transformation over social status and bragging rights. BootsnAll continues this today via publishing long form content on independent travel, around the world and long-term travel guides, a curated community and a most excellent newsletter.
