It helps those incoming projects (called "podlings") adopt the Apache style of governance and operation and guides them to the ASF services available to our projects so they can become top-level ASF projects ("TLPs"). The Incubator delegates a few mentors for each podling to act as liaisons with the various ASF teams: Incubator PMC, Infrastructure team, etc., and facilitate the podling’s growth and operations. Incubator History The Incubator was created in 2002. As of April, 2023 it has helped 335 podlings, of which 239 have graduated. More than 300 mentors have guided and supported podlings. There are between 25 and 50 podlings in incubation at any one time, and incubation typically takes 1 1/2 years. Incubator Cookbook Our cookbook helps potential podlings decide whether the ASF is a good fit for them and guides them through the steps required to become an ASF podling. Incubator Talks There have been many Incubator talks at many conferences over the years. Here are a few of them.

About The Apache Software Foundation The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of open source software projects. The Foundation provides an established framework for intellectual property and financial contributions that simultaneously limits potential legal exposure for the contributors. Through a collaborative and meritocratic development process known as "the Apache Way", Apache projects deliver enterprise-grade, freely-available software products that attract large communities of users. The pragmatic and business-friendly Apache License makes it easy for all users, commercial and individual, to deploy Apache products.
