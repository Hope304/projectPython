Permafrost is a permanently frozen layer below Earth’s surface. It consists of soil, gravel, and sand, usually bound together by ice.

The two main types are continental glaciers (or ice sheets) and alpine glaciers.

There are only two ice sheets worldwide today, the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. They contain more than 99 percent of the land ice on Earth.Explore Ice Sheets DataLearn more about ice sheetsBrowse related data collectionsNASA Earthdata CloudGLIMS: Global Land Ice Measurements from Space Operation IceBridgeICESat/GLASICESat-2MEaSUREsBrowse related research projects QGreenland Project closeIce shelvesAn ice shelf is a large floating platform of ice that forms where a glacier or ice sheet flows down to a coastline and onto the ocean surface. Ice shelves play an important role in slowing the flow of ice from glaciers or ice sheets into the ocean. When ice shelves collapse, research has shown that glaciers accelerate, flowing into the ocean and adding to sea level rise.

It grows during each hemisphere’s winter; and it retreats in the summer, but does not completely disappear. The highly reflective white surface of sea ice reflects solar energy, cooling the planet. When it melts, the darker ocean absorbs more heat, reinforcing the cycle of melting sea ice.

It is not frozen rain, but a crystallization of ice that typically forms in clouds. Highly reflective, white snow bounces solar energy back into space instead of warming the planet. Mountain snowpacks also provide a slow release of fresh water into rivers and waterways.
