Trusted by the World’s Leading Organizations The beauty of the Haivision technology is that it turns right on, everything just lines up and locks in, video is being transported, and people are ready to go to work. It’s a testament to how battle-tested it is. Brad Cheney VP Field Operations and Engineering, Fox Sports The Haivision system takes our tactical operations center and creates a hyper-realistic training environment with the ability to customize displays and show multiple programs and feeds. It allows every member of the Strike team to build real-time situational awareness and prosecute as if they were working with the same technology they will see when they head down range. Kris Westendorff Mag Subject Matter Expert, MQ-9 Reaper The main criterion for the project was that we work with a collaborative partner to build an ecosystem where we all find new opportunities – for us, that absolutely was Haivision. The Haivision Air itself was a clear choice, having already been battletested by our team in other scenarios. Equipped with the latest generation cellular connectivity, the compact live video transmitter offered the flexibility needed for this proof of concept. Juan Cambeiro 5G Customer Innovation team, Telefónica The capabilities of the Haivision video wall and the technology that drives it have been instrumental in helping us to accomplish our mission when an emergency response is needed. It has proved to be a great success and an extremely useful tool that we have come to depend and rely upon. Without it, we wouldn’t be nearly as effective. Fred Szabo Emergency Manager, Cleveland Office of Emergency Management, Cleveland Department of Public Safety No other company offers the compact form factor of the Makito X4 encoder, which allows us to simultaneously send streams from four cameras in sync back to our studio in 200 milliseconds, it’s been a total game-changer. We turned it on and immediately saw the benefits. Not only has the Makito X4 made our workflows easier and faster to set up, but it has also made our overall production look better.
