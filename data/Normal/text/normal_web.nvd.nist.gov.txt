You will temporarily see delays in analysis efforts during this transition. We apologize for the inconvenience and ask for your patience as we work to improve the NVD program. New 2.0 APIs Change Timeline New Parameters The NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, product names, and impact metrics. For information on how to the cite the NVD, including the database's Digital Object Identifier (DOI), please consult NIST's Public Data Repository.
