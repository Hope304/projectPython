Varnish HTTP Cache — Varnish HTTP Cache Varnish HTTP Cache¶ I’m new here, please explain this Varnish thing What is happening¶ 2024-02-06 - SLASH/ 1.0.0-rc1¶ Celebrating the 18th anniversary of Varnish-Cache and the first anniversary of the SLASH/ storage engines today, your Open-Source Varnish-Cache friends from UPLEX have just tagged the first version 1.0.0 candidate of our extension with storage engines (stevedores) and storage routers (loadmasters). Over the past year, we have received a lot of helpful input from our users and have implemented substantial improvements. THANK YOU to everyone who has contributed by reporting issues, providing feedback and, just recently, adding documentation. SLASH/fellow has also helped improve Varnish-Cache itself. After rigorous testing in particular over the past weeks, we now boldly claim that SLASH/ deserves a 1.0 version tag. HAPPY BIRTHDAY Varnish-Cache! HAPPY BIRTHDAY SLASH/buddy and SLASH/fellow!
