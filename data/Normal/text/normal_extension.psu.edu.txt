However, we needed the science. It's all that partnership and education. I've learned so much through the years working with extension. It's been a great thing.Frank ConnettManager of Flock Services at Kreider FarmsManagement of forest invasives has been a very large problem for me, and I've managed to keep on top of it, but I found the resources offered by extension have been very valuable in that. It is very helpful because if you talk to the professionals who do it, you get a very different view point and in many cases you could be wasting thousands of dollars in doing the wrong thing, or the right thing at the wrong time. I found that having the resources from extension has aided me in many ways.John HooverBald Eagle Tree FarmThe extension programs have given me reference making me a much better steward of our property and a better understanding of how the ecosystem fits together. Since I've been managing it, we've seen a return of fishers and beavers to our stream so we are getting back pieces to the ecosystem that have been missing.Susan Shoemaker-BenedictBeartown Family Limited PartnershipPenn State has been an integral part of the business since I’ve been here. We do about 3.5 million pounds of fresh sausage a year. We’ve relied on Penn State many times because we do not have the budget to have a full-time person here that deals with food safety or research and development.Len CaricPresident/CEO Uncle Charley’s Sausage Co.We work very closely with Penn State Extension, and that has been instrumental in developing best practices and new processes and technologies, both in the orchard and the packhouse.Danijel LolicRice Fruit CompanyI really appreciate the instructors from Penn State Extension mostly because they serve as a really good resource.
