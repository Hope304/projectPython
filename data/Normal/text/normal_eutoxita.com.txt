EUTOXITA EUTOXITA Welcome! I'm switching over from my host's blogging feature to Blogger. It just offers more possibilities--including the option for YOU to subscribe. Check it out! mail@eutoxita.com EUTOXITA trainwreck is now available! Did you notice the sales link above? ALSO... I am currently taking part in the RPM Challenge, creating a soundtrack for the 1922 F. W. Murnau film Nosferatu. You can check out the particulars here. (The old blah blah blah is below... with links...) This is the official website for EUTOXITA. EUTOXITA is the A.K.A. for James White... me. So why EUTOXITA? The simple answer is that my real name is ridiculously common. Also, the name "Jim's Big Ego" was already taken. I am an independent musical artist (James Blanco, Bird In The Badlands) and producer (Kevin Farley's The Invisible Thread). I am also a member of the bands Floodwatch and Those Charming Deviationists. I dabble in filmmaking, both animated and educational. I'm currently getting quite a few hits for my educational hip-hop song, "5 Themes of Geography", available for viewing on YouTube and TeacherTube. YouTube offered me revenue sharing, but I have so far declined, as I hate those little pop-up ads. Ironically, TeacherTube didn't ask--they just threw an ad on and I get no share! Floodwatch's David Steadman and I are currently working on a side project called My Father's Guns. I'm in the process of mixing my next solo CD under the name EUTOXITA (again... there are a kazillion guys "James Blanco" so I've ditched that alias). Some of the rough mixes are already up on my MySpace page (Life Is Rushing By, When I Was A Child, Late Night Radio, When I Get Old). Stay tuned for details. If you want to hear/see more, you should really check out my MySpace page. I love parentheses and ellipses. Thanks, Jim P.S. Notice all the I's up there? It really is too bad "Jim's Big Ego" was already taken...
