Set against the backdrop of California’s rich history and heritage, we will explore the intriguing theme of “Globalization: Perspectives from the Past” amidst Sacramento’s backdrop of lush parks, historic landmarks, and a vibrant cultural scene.Discover how earlier eras of globalization shape our present and future while engaging in thought-provoking conversations with fellow experts. This isn’t just another convention; it’s your chance to challenge conventions, connect with like-minded scholars, and uncover new dimensions of economic history. Read More Globalization: Perspectives from the Past The theme for the EHA 2024 meeting is Globalization: Perspectives from the Past. Globalization refers to the movement of goods, services, people, capital, and technology across countries. By many measures, the twenty-first century has become more globalized than at any time in history, yet its future is in doubt with the rise of geopolitical conflict and doubts about its benefits to workers in advanced countries. How do earlier eras of globalization compare, and what also can be learned from the interconnected nature of markets and people, which goes back to ancient times? How have government policies toward globalization differed across countries and changed over time? New data sources and methodologies have allowed researchers to examine the political, economic, and social consequences of increased trade and finance as well as migration across countries over longer periods of time and spanning a richer set of countries across the globe. Jeremy Land, Ph.D. Postdoctoral Researcher University of Gothenberg EHA Meeting Coordinator THE 2023 ECONOMIC SCIENCES LAUREATE Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences Congratulations to this year’s economic sciences laureate, Claudia Goldin, who provided the first comprehensive account of women’s earnings and labour market participation through the centuries. Claudia is a Harvard Professor and an EHA Member.By trawling through the archives and compiling and correcting historical data, Goldin has been able to present new and often surprising facts. The fact that women’s choices have often been, and remain, limited by marriage and responsibility for the home and family is at the heart of her analyses and explanatory models.Her insights reach far outside the borders of the US and similar patterns have been observed in many other countries. Her research brings us a better understanding of the labour markets of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
