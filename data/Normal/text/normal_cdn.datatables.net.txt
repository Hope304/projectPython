Furthermore, the CDN can serve the files for the DataTables components and dependencies that you require as a single concatenated and minified file, or as individual files through use of the DataTables download builder. All you then need to do is include the files you want on your page! This can help improve performance on your site and make prototyping much easier. The DataTables CDN is powered by the CloudFlare network. DataTables DataTables is the core software of the DataTables project, and involves two primary files, the DataTables Javascript and CSS. Documentation, usage and examples Release notes Previous releases Release DataTables 2.0.1 is the current stable release of DataTables.

The grouping is shown as an inserted row either before or after the group. Documentation, usage and examples Release notes Previous releases CSS JS RowReorder RowReorder adds the ability for rows in a DataTable to be reordered through user interaction with the table (click and drag / touch and drag). Integration with Editor's multi-row editing feature is also available to update rows immediately.

Documentation, usage and examples Release notes Previous releases CSS JS SearchBuilder SearchBuilder provides the end user with an easy to use UI for them to create their own complex custom search expression for a DataTable. When searching through large sets of data for specific data, this can be extremely useful. Documentation, usage and examples Release notes Previous releases CSS JS SearchPanes SearchPanes adds panes to the DataTable with the capability to search by selecting rows in the panes. This is very useful when it comes to adding a more comprehensive searching feature and custom search capabilities. Documentation, usage and examples Release notes Previous releases CSS JS Select Select is an extension for DataTables that provides table item selection capabilities - rows, columns and cells. Advanced selection options are available for multi-item selection and also item selection and retrieval via the DataTables API. Documentation, usage and examples Release notes Previous releases CSS JS StateRestore StateRestore extends DataTables state saving abilities, allowing multiple states to be saved and reloaded at any time. There is also the possibility to customise which elements of DataTables are stored in each saved state. Documentation, usage and examples Release notes Previous releases CSS JS Plugins The DataTables plug-ins are a little different from the software above in that they do not have a specific release. Rather, for the CDN, each commit is available using the initial part of the git hash for each commit, to ensure that the version of the file that you use is always available for your use and will not change version unexpectedly. Furthermore, note that the use of plug-ins on the CDN is primarily for prototyping. Although you can include plug-ins on your page directly from the CDN, if you are using multiple plug-ins, you will benefit from combining those plug-ins that you are using into a single file to keep the number of imported files to a minimum.
