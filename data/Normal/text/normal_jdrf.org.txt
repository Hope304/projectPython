See All Events Near You Meet some of the people behind the movement to end T1D “We are all in this together.” “JDRF has always been my best resource for the latest information.” “JDRF really is so tremendously positive and effective.” “I can’t imagine how different this journey would have been without JDRF.” “JDRF is ... a strong force for change.” “I own the fact that I have T1D.” Stories From Our Community Keyoshi Carr “We are all in this together. To be able to go to the Walk and see that we are a community makes all the difference to my family,” Carmen Carr, Keyoshi Carr’s mother. Keyoshi’s family changed forever when her older sibling was diagnosed with T1D. They quickly became active members of the JDRF community, doing school fundraisers, T1D education workshops and starting a JDRF One Walk team. Six years later, the unimaginable happened again. Keyoshi was diagnosed with T1D. She had been a participant in TrialNet, a JDRF-funded program that offers risk screening for relatives of people with T1D. She had tested positive for antibodies, so her parents we’re watching for the symptoms. They credit TrialNet with potentially saving her life. Dan Hamilton When Dan Hamilton was diagnosed with T1D in 1972, the doctor told him he wouldn’t live past 50. Fast forward 45 years, and Dan is strong and healthy at 59. He credits his health to the advancements in treatment and care over the years. He has been an early adopter of every technology that has come along, and exercises regularly as part of a healthy lifestyle. Dan has found he has had to be a strong advocate for himself with healthcare providers. He had made sure to work with clinics and professionals that specialize in T1D and keep up with the latest technology and treatment options. He enjoys mentoring others with T1D and helping them discover a path to staying strong and minimizing complications. Maddy Arnstein Maddy Arnstein has lived with T1D for over 50 years. She became involved with JDRF when she saw the dramatic difference technologies like the insulin pump could have on her life. Maddy was quickly drawn to advocacy—initially to help secure continued renewal of funding for the Special Diabetes Program (SDP). But once she started using a continuous glucose monitor, she dedicated herself to fighting for Medicare coverage. In 2017, Maddy took part in JDRF Government Day, meeting with her members of Congress. She offered a unique perspective, as she’s seen first-hand how far research has come over the years. “Because I’m very action-oriented, I can’t tolerate just sitting around and discussing something with no results,” Maddy says. “Through JDRF I can actually help make things better for the next generation.” Will Stevens When Will Stevens complained of aches and pains, the doctor advised his mother, Cassie, to give him a baked potato before basketball practice and to make sure he had plenty of Gatorade to drink. Will’s health went from bad to worse. He lost weight and was tired all the time. When they went to the hospital, Will was diagnosed with T1D. The family spent four days at the hospital learning a “new normal” and trying not to feel overwhelmed. Soon after, the Stevens started participating in JDRF events and became part of the JDRF community, something they describe as a “game changer.” Ariana Shakibinia Ariana Shakibinia decided to study public health in large part because she lives with T1D. She had always been interested in public policy, but she says living with this disease has made her more vested in the healthcare conversation. “ I am living with what is essentially a pre-existing condition. I’m fortunate enough to have good health insurance, but it makes the potential financial burden of T1D management much more visible and relatable.” The JDRF community has enabled Ariana to connect with people across the country she wouldn’t normally meet. She finds it incredible how JDRF advocacy has mobilized a small group of people to do big things—like securing bipartisan support for the Special Diabetes Program, which provides $150 million annually to T1D research. Tyler Newbold “I own the fact that I have T1D, and am grateful about some of the things I’ve learned and the people I’ve met throughout my experience,” says Tyler Newbold. Tyler played college basketball at Utah State from 2007-2011, and had the opportunity to play in three NCAA tournaments. His coaches and trainers always had Gatorade or candy on hand in case his blood glucose dropped during a game. Tyler tested his blood glucose right before training, and during halftime breaks. He says working out and playing basketball has helped him to better control his T1D. Tyler got involved with JDRF One Walk when he was in college; as a basketball player, he was asked to be the celebrity speaker. “It was an awesome and humbling experience to help younger children understand that they can still achieve their dreams.” Previous of Next Coverage 2 Control JDRF’s experts partner with our volunteers across the nation to advocate for affordability, choice, and coverage of the T1D therapies that work best for you.
