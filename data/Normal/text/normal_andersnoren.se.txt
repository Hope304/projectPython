Anders Norén Anders Norén About Themes Writing GitHub Instagram Twitter My name is Anders Norén. I’m a designer and developer from Vemdalen, Sweden. Scroll for more I design and develop websites and services, usually with WordPress. I’ve also worked with branding and editorial design, and written for websites and magazines. I’ve released 30 free WordPress themes that have been downloaded 4 million times and are used on hundreds of thousands of websites. I also designed and helped build Twenty Twenty, the default theme in WordPress 5.3. When I’m not hunched in front of a computer, I try to spend as much time outside as possible. Preferably for days at a time, with everything I need on my back. You can follow along on my hiking adventures on my Instagram. I enjoy musicals, would die without coffee, spend too much time on video games, and watch an unreasonable amount of movies.
