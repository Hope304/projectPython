Watch now → ★ 7.95 INCENTIVE Documentary Film is a broad category of visual expression that is based on the attempt, in one fashion or another, to document reality. Knowledge comes in different ways through our five senses. Hearing, watching, touching, smelling and tasting are the only doorways to the outer world. The wise men say that if something is not truly experienced with all our five senses, the experience will be partial, not total. Therefore in a way almost all our gained knowledge through life is partial. And maybe they are right. If we follow that analogy, gaining knowledge through several senses simultaneously is better than through just one. So, educating through watching educational videos, in this case documentaries, is really a total different experience than educating only on books. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to undermine the books in any way. Having said that, lets go and check out some great docs right here, right now.
