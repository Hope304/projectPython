Something Odd! Skip to content Something Odd! Menu WordPress Plugins About Random Search for: Android Resize Images with Tasker Motivated by the change in Google Photos that stopped offering “free storage” I worked on a script that would resize images on my Android phone and released the first version in November 2022. The script requires Tasker to run. There were a couple of problems with it, however. I wasn’t entirely happy with the workflow. I put up with these downsides for quite a while, occasionally researching how to fix the disappearing image problem, but I couldn’t find any good answer until last month. I found out that Tasker must run the “Media Scan” command when it creates a new […] Read more Email “Verify this email is yours” spam Yesterday I got an unusual email spam. It hit my inbox on Fastmail, coming from my Google account. The spam link was embedded in the actual email address, using the plus notation that Gmail supports. On Fastmail, the link wasn’t clickable, but on Gmail it was. When I checked Gmail, the email had been moved into Spam, so I guess they were dealing with many copies of this. Surprisingly, the link is still clickable, even with the email in the Spam folder. I thought I hadn’t received spam like this before but looking at it again, I think I did. […] Read more Web When you move IP, move all the IPs I recently moved the server hosting this site and my photoblog to a new Linode. About time too as the old one was full of cruft built up over a decade of upgrades. It had finally reached the point where I had trouble finding new dpkg files for software that wasn’t as ancient as my installation. Updates would stop in the next year or two as well, which was a huge problem. When I did move, I pointed the DNS at my new server and all seemed fine. That is, until I saw an email from Google on Friday saying […] Read more Email A Mastodon account is an email to spammers This morning I received a spam email where the spammer accidentally CCed everyone, instead of BCCing them. They also seemed to have spammed many people named Donncha, so hopefully none of them reply-all asking to unsubscribe. It’s not the first time, but they included an “email address” that isn’t an email address. They used my @donncha@mastodon.ie Mastodon account. They also included my Gmail address, which is how I received the email. I started receiving email to this blog’s @donncha@odd.blog address and to photoblog’s @donncha@inphotos.org address too, but I’ve blocked them already. If you publish the address of your self-hosted Mastodon […] Read more Fediverse View at Home 0.1 View at Home is a simple Tampermonkey script to make interacting with Mastodon (and probably other Fediverse services) easier. When you open a Mastodon post, it’s not possible to comment or favourite it unless it’s on your own home instance. The usual way of dealing with this is by copying the link into the search box of your own instance and clicking the resulting link. This script will add a “View at home” button to the top left of the page when you look at a Mastodon site. By clicking on this button, it will search for that page on […] Read more Health F***ing Kidney Stones The pain I’ve felt in the last few days because of a tiny little stone inside in my body is worse than anything I’ve ever experienced. Absolutely excruciating and uncomfortable. It’s weird drinking lots of water only for my mouth to be dry moments later. I’m feeling ok right now, at this moment, but I doubt that it’s over yet. I’ve been to the doctor and following his advice. Yet again, feeling so lucky to be married to a wonderful woman who takes such good care of sick ol’ me. Read more Ireland Blarney is Frozen Schools are back this morning, but temperatures are staying around 2ºC (feels like -3ºC) which would be manageable except it rained around 4am this morning. Local roads are lethal, with vehicles already skidding and crashing. A double-decker bus skidded on black ice at one end of the village and blocked the road completely. Twenty minutes later, two delivery trucks jackknifed after coming down the hill coming from the opposite side of the village. I live on a hill, and watched cars come down it very, very slowly. Thankfully, no incidents there yet. Pictures come from the Blarney Blog on Facebook. […] Read more Food The box of Roses was opened What’s your favourite Rose? I do like Dairy milk, but the Hazelnut ones are even better. The rest of my family don’t like the fruit flavoured ones. Someone had to eat them. Yum. Read more tv TIL about Star Trek Continues The fan mad web series, Star Trek Continues, published their first episode in 2013 according to Wikipedia. Somehow, I think I have never heard of it, despite loving Star Trek. Better late than never, and I enjoyed the first episode this morning. It’s all available on YouTube. The series continues on where the original series ended, with the 5-year mission of the Enterprise being wrapped up in the last 2 episodes. I recognised the computer voice in episode 1, and I see from Wikipedia that other guest stars make an appearance too. Definitely worth a watch if you’re a Star […] Read more Music Celebrating Shane MacGowan at his funeral This is a fantastic way to celebrate someone’s life. RIP Shane.
