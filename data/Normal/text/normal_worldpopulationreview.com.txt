This total far exceeds the 2015 world population of 7.2 billion. The world's population continues to increase by roughly 140 people per minute, with births outweighing deaths in most countries. Overall, however, the rate of population growth has been slowing for several decades. This slowdown is expected to continue until the rate of population growth reaches zero (an equal number of births and deaths) around 2080-2100, at a population of approximately 10.4 billion people. After this time, the population growth rate is expected to turn negative, resulting in global population decline. Countries with more than 1 billion people China is currently the most populous country in the world, with a population estimated at more than 1.42 billion as of September 2022. Only one other country in the world boasts a population of more than 1 billion people: India, whose population is estimated to be 1.41 billion people—and rising. While India's population is projected to continue to grow until at least the year 2050, China's population is currently contracting slightly. This contraction, coupled with India's continued growth, is expected to result in India replacing China as the most populous country in the world by the year 2030. Countries with more than 100 million people Another 12 countries each have populations that exceeded 100 million people as of September 2022: Country Population Country Population United States 338,653,036 Russia 144,704,502 Indonesia 275,908,026 Mexico 127,724,673 Pakistan 236,882,454 Japan 123,801,638 Nigeria 219,741,895 Ethiopia 124,095,535 Brazil 215,538,160 Philippines 115,969,226 Bangladesh 171,594,827 Egypt 111,384,124 While Russia and Japan will see their populations decline significantly by 2050, the rest of these nations are expected to continue growing until at least 2050. Additionally, two additional countries, DR Congo and Vietnam, have more than 99 million people and should soon reach the 100 million mark. Countries with fewer than 100 million people As shown in the live-updating population table below, the overwhelming majority of the world's countries have fewer than 100 million people—substantially fewer, in some cases. The smallest country in the world in terms of both population and total area is Vatican City, where barely 500 people reside. Population range # of countries 1 billion or more 2 100 million to 999.9 million 12 10 million to 99.9 million 80 1 million to 9.9 million 66 less than 1 million 74 Rates of population growth around the world The world's population continues to increase, with approximately 140 million babies born every year. According to the United Nations' 2022 World Population Prospects report, the global population is projected to reach 8.5 billion people by the year 2030, 9.7 billion people by 2050, and 10.4 billion people by 2080, where it will remain until 2100. While the world's total population is expected to continue to rise until roughly 2100, the rate at which the population is rising has been slowly decreasing for decades. In 2020, the global population growth rate fell below one percent for the first time since 1950. This decrease continues a trend begun in the 1970s, in which the population growth rate shows a consistent decrease when measured in five-year increments. The rate of population growth varies greatly from one country or region to another. More than half of the world's expected population growth between now and 2050 is expected to come from just eight countries: DR Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Tanzania. Particularly of interest is India, which is on track to overtake China's position as the most populous country by the year 2030. Additionally, multiple nations within Africa are expected to double their populations in the coming decades as fertility rates and birth rates rise thanks in part to advancements in medical care and decreased infant mortality and malnutrition. Life expectancy and its impact on world population Global life expectancy has also improved in recent years, rising to 72.8 years in 2019—almost 9 years longer than in 1990. Global life expectancy is projected to continue to increase, reaching 77.2 years by the year 2050. Significant factors impacting the data on life expectancy include expectations regarding mankind's ability to reduce the impact of AIDS/HIV and other infectious and non-communicable diseases. As a result of the increase in global life expectancy, the majority of the world's countries are undergoing considerable growth in the number of residents over the age of 65. The percentage of over-65 residents in the world's population is projected to rise from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050. This total will be roughly twice the number of children under age 5 and equal to the number of children under age 12. This imbalance can put considerable strain on a country's economy and infrastructure, as it can lead to a shortage of working-age individuals entering the workforce to take the place of those who are retiring. Life expectancy has a significant impact on the ability of the population to maintain what is called a replacement rate, in which the country's death rate is balanced or exceeded by its birth rate. In countries whose birth rates are either deliberately low or unintentionally so, the death rate may be higher, resulting in overall population decline. Although population decline can be desirable in certain circumstances, it can also create economic challenges and is more often viewed as undesired. Challenges inherent in population estimates Although population projections such as the US Census Bureau's World Population Clock utilize the most accurate and up-to-date data available, they are nonetheless still estimates. Unforeseen events such as the COVID-19 pandemic or Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine can have a powerful, but impossible-to-anticipate impact on population trends. Even in the absence of such disruptions, the process of tracking the exact number of births and deaths in every country and territory in the world in real time—and maintaining a precise tally of the number of people alive on the Earth at any given moment—is logistically infeasible. Instead, modern population scientists use sophisticated mathematical models to create detailed estimates and projections, which the world's countries can use to plan for future generations.2024 World Population 8,005,176,000Choose Year to Display Below:202320502030201020001980 CSV JSONDownload Table Data I agree to receive email from World Population ReviewEnter your email below, and you'll receive this table's data in your inbox momentarily.SendX2024 World Population by Country (Live)Show SourceWorld Population History CSV JSONDownload Table Data I agree to receive email from World Population ReviewEnter your email below, and you'll receive this table's data in your inbox momentarily.SendXYearPopulationGrowth Rate20248,118,835,9990.91%20238,045,311,4470.86%20207,840,952,8801.09%20157,426,597,5371.23%20106,985,603,1051.27%20056,558,176,1191.3%20006,148,898,9751.37%19955,743,219,4541.56%19905,316,175,8621.8%19854,861,730,6131.81%19804,444,007,7061.78%19754,069,437,2311.95%19703,695,390,3362.06%19653,337,111,9832.02%19603,019,233,4341.91%19552,746,072,1411.9%19502,499,322,157 showing: 17 rowsWorld Population Projections CSV JSONDownload Table Data I agree to receive email from World Population ReviewEnter your email below, and you'll receive this table's data in your inbox momentarily.SendXYearPopulationGrowth Rate20258,191,988,4530.9%20308,546,141,3270.85%20358,879,397,4010.77%20409,188,250,4920.69%20459,467,543,5750.6%20509,709,491,7610.51%20559,908,304,8690.41%206010,067,733,6060.32%206510,195,964,9000.25%207010,297,166,7110.2%207510,370,994,1980.14%208010,414,637,1890.08%208510,430,679,1010.03%209010,423,541,036-0.01%209510,396,305,844-0.05%210010,349,323,038-0.09%showing: 16 rowsWorld Population in 2050World Population By RaceWorld Population (1950 - 2100) CSV JSONDownload Table Data I agree to receive email from World Population ReviewEnter your email below, and you'll receive this table's data in your inbox momentarily.SendXTerritoryCountryPopulationArea (km²)Land Area (km²)Aland IslandsFinland30,1291.6K1.6KCocos (Keeling) IslandsAustralia5961414ChristmasAustralia1,843135135Norfolk IslandAustralia1,7483635Pitcairn IslandsUnited Kingdom504747Svalbard and Jan MayanNorway2,93961K61KAkrotiri and DhekeliaUnited Kingdom18,195254254Saint HelenaUnited Kingdom5,714394394SabaNetherlands1,9331313BonaireNetherlands20,915288288Sint EustatiusNetherlands3,1392121United States Minor Outlying IslandsUnited States3003434showing: 12 rowsOther Minor Territories and Dependencies CSV JSONDownload Table Data I agree to receive email from World Population ReviewEnter your email below, and you'll receive this table's data in your inbox momentarily.SendXCountry2024 Population2020 Population2011 PopulationArea (km²)Density (/km²)Growth RateEngland58,197,30756,550,13853,012,456130.3K4470.72%Scotland5,543,5755,466,0005,295,40378.8K710.35%Wales3,217,9283,169,5863,063,45620.8K1550.38%Northern Ireland1,932,7521,895,5101,814,31814.1K1370.49%Kosovo1,806,3221,798,1881,780,02110.9K1660.11%showing: 5 rowsOther Limited Data CountriesWorld Population History (5000 B.C. - 2020 A.D.)

Before the invention of agriculture, for example, the human population was estimated to be around 15 million people at most. For comparison, the world population in 2017 (~7 billion) was roughly equal to a full 6% of the estimated 110 billion people who have ever lived. The introduction of agriculture and the gradual movement of humanity into settled communities enabled the global population to increase gradually to around 300 million by AD 0. While this is a substantial increase, it remains a tiny fraction of the current population. For example, the Roman Empire, which historians regard as one of the strongest empires the world has ever known, probably contained around 50 million people at its height—nearly 20 million less than the population of the UK today. The world population would not reach its first major milestone—one billion people—until the early 19th century. Then, as the industrial revolution took hold and living standards improved, the rate of population growth increased considerably. Over the next hundred years, the population of the world doubled, reaching two billion in the late 1920s. During the 20th century, however, population growth skyrocketed. Over the past 100 years, the planet's population has more than tripled in size. This massive increase in human population is largely due to improvements in diet, sanitation, and medicine, especially compulsory vaccination against many diseases, which have both improved life expectancy and decreased infant mortality rates all over the world.

Most population experts agree that population increases will continue, albeit at an ever-decreasing rate, until the Earth's population reaches its ceiling, pauses, and begins to contract. However, the particulars of that process, such as the rate of increase, when and at what number the population will plateau, and the rate of decrease that will follow, are still the subject of much debate. Most population experts tag steadily improving global standards of living as the cause of decreasing rates of population increase. As wealth and quality of life increase, the average family size will shrink and population growth will steadily slow and eventually stop. However, other experts maintain that poverty, inequality and continued urbanization will have the opposite effect and cause a growth increase, particularly in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, where population growth is already much higher than the global average. Still others predict a population decrease stemming from much bleaker causes. These experts speculate that the current world population is unsustainable in the long term and that humanity will reach a point at which we simply cannot produce enough food or utilize our natural resources efficiently enough to feed such a large population or sustain the global economy at its current scale.World Population History ChartShow SourceWorld Population Growth ChartShow SourceWorld Population Prospects (2022 Revision) - United Nations population estimates and projections.Historical Estimates of World PopulationSources© 2024 World Population Review Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout
