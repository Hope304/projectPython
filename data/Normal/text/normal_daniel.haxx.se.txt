Daniel Stenberg - daniel.haxx.se front | blog | talks | videos | docs | photos | podcasts | contact | about me Daniel Stenberg I am the founder and lead developer of cURL and libcurl. An internet protocol geek, an open source person and a developer. I've been programming for fun and profit since 1985. You'll find lots of info about my various Open Source projects on these web pages and on my GitHub profile. My name appears in products. I participate within the IETF, primarily in the HTTPbis and QUIC working groups. I speak in public every now and then. I stream curl development on twitch occasionally. I work for wolfSSL from home doing commercial curl support. If you need help to fix curl problems, fix your app's use of libcurl, add features to curl, fix curl bugs, optimize your curl use or libcurl education for your developers... Then I'm your man. Contact us! I write weekly email reports you can read. Almost like a newsletter. I receive a fair amount of curious emails.
