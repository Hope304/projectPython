Symptoms include sweating, nausea, heart palpitations, hypervigilance, paranoia, and the fear or feeling that you might be dying or about to die. A green out is typically caused by smoking or ingesting too much cannabis too quickly.Green outs are generally brief experiences and may be followed by exhaustion or drowsiness, or a rapid sobering.Unlike black outs, memory loss doesn't tend to occur during a green out due to the intensity of a green out.Memory loss is much more likely to occur during a long, sustained session of cannabis use.Unlike alcohol, cannabis use affects short term memory (what was I saying?) and not long term memory (what did I do last night?).Sativa strains may be more likely to cause green outs (while indicas are more likely to leave you stoned)Person 1: Dude, don't smoke so much. you'll green out. Person 2: pshh, green out, sure, whatever. (green outs vary depending on the circumstances so it's difficult to describe a specific example, and it can take multiple green outs to really understand what's happening when you have one). Person 2, now an experienced pothead: Dude, don't smoke so much. you'll green out. Person 3: pshh, green out, sure, whatever.by thatonespecificguy April 8, 2018FlagGet the green out mug.Gentleman's BWhen you have a good enough grade in your class and you are so bogged down by other work at the end of the semester that you email your professor and tell him you're not gonna take the exam and will take a "B" in his classStudent in email: "Dear Professor, my finals period is packed and its just not worth it for me to not sleep for the next three days to get a good grade on the test since I have a really good grade in the class already.
