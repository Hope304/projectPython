We all know with one click what projects we are working on, what is happening next, who is involved, deadlines and so much other important information. As a manager, I know exactly how long a project takes from initial idea to finished production, and this tracking makes my job easier.“ Daniel Claudet, Manager, Hope Channel Southeast Asia Read the story Schedule Work 🥳 Optimize use of resources, avoid scheduling conflicts, and delegate tasks without losing sight of the big picture. 🙂 Keep all the details in one place with images, files, links, notes, and time-stamped event comments. 👏 Streamline communication and easily maintain records.

We have mechanical technicians, fiberglass repair technicians, sub-contractors and daily boat launch/haul-out tasks. We previously used a combination of whiteboards, outlook/google calendars (yuck!), and spreadsheets to schedule everything. It was a big headache! We now use Teamup to schedule our technicians – a vast improvement over the whiteboard method. The ability to prevent overlapping events in each technician’s calendar is a huge advantage.” Jonathan Paige, Chicago Yacht Works Read more user stories “Your calendar has been a lifesaver in desperate times. Our family of seven needed a way to schedule AND track AND assign who would accompany my inlaws, both nonagenarians, to medical appointments. By assigning subcalendars to each of us, with different colors (and black for “UNASSIGNED”), we are able to see when the next appointment is, who’s got it, and to fill in descriptions of items discussed in the Description field.” John Donohue Share your story User Story: Field Service Operations “The varied permissions are still OUR biggest luxury with this calendar as well. We have so many varied positions and each one only needs a piece of the calendar to do their job. With Teamup, we can basically organize the entire company’s production process without confusing or overloading any of our departments with information that they do not need.” Teresa Ortiz, Project Manager, Holbrook Asphalt Read the story Manage Availability ✌️ Eliminate the back-and-forth of checking on availability. 😉 Enable self-booking and keep central access control: no risk of unwanted alteration to existing bookings. 🧐 Customize information disclosure based on user roles; keep sensitive data safe and ensure protection of privacy.

We use Teamup in our Diabetes and Metabolism Research Institute because we can no longer freely use all of the equipment, instruments, and services available in our building without first controlling traffic in our labs and specialty rooms. It is a terrific solution.” John Kaddis, Assistant Professor, City of Hope National Medical Center Share your story “We are a professional ballet company in NY (with approx. 90 dancers), along with the school for students ages 3-18. We house 9 studios total, shared among different programs and departments (including outside rentals). It is immensely efficient to have a streamlined system (our old way was having an excel spreadsheet that didn’t allow remote access) that is simple yet effective.” Miki Shintani, Rehearsal Planning Manage, American Ballet Theatre Read more stories User Story: Horse Stable Scheduling “The good thing about Teamup is that you can really adapt it to your needs very easily. Thus, with one or more individual calendars, you can also manage allocations for riding arenas, halls, stalls, equipment, and more at the stable… The big advantage compared to scheduling appointments with WhatsApp and other messenger services is that you can always keep an eye on future appointments (e.g. hoof groomer comes in two weeks). Overlaps of appointments become immediately visible and the calendar can be set to prevent them from being allowed in the first place.“ Markus Erdmann, Publisher, Country-Reiten.de Read the story Share Events 👀 Publicize events anywhere with easy share and embed options. 🖼️ Consolidate events from multiple sources into one view. Decentralize event management efficiently and securely. ⌛ Reduce information silos across organizational units and increase transparency for better collaboration.

We feel like we were saved from some nightmare trying to manage the calendar on one end, the events on another and then the registration on yet another platform.“ Benoit Rouleau, Vice président, Vélo Plaisirs Read more stories User Story: UN Web TV Live Schedule “The UN Webcast team is very busy.
