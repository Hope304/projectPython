Based on _s from github What is Underscores? Hi. I'm a starter theme called _s, or underscores, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for. My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here ... Learn more about me in "A 1000-Hour Head Start: Introducing The _s Theme" on ThemeShaper. A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates. A helpful 404 template. An optional sample custom header implementation in inc/custom-header.php. Custom template tags in inc/template-tags.php that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication. Some small tweaks in inc/template-functions.php that can improve your theming experience. A script at js/navigation.js that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. 2 sample CSS layouts in layouts/ for a sidebar on either side of your content. Smartly organized starter CSS in style.css that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground. Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.
