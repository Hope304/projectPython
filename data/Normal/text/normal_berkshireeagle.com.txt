More in Opinion Massachusetts News State AP Decision Notes: What to expect in Super Tuesday's presidential nominating contests By ROBERT YOON - Associated PressUpdated 12 hrs ago With contests in 16 states and American Samoa, the Super Tuesday primaries will be the largest day of voting of the year outside of the November election. Both Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican front-runner Donald Trump hope to amass a string of lopsided victories that will help them move beyond the primaries and focus on their expected general election rematch. Trump rival Nikki Haley faces a tough slate of contests, mostly in the types of reliably Republican-voting states where she has struggled to win support or in states where party rules heavily favor the front-runner. Super Tuesday has the largest delegate haul of any day in the primary calendar. State Fanatics founder Michael Rubin says company unfairly blamed for new MLB uniforms By JIMMY GOLEN - AP Sports WriterUpdated Mar 1, 2024 Fanatics founder Michael Rubin says his company is being unfairly blamed for new Major League Baseball uniforms that have see-through pants and other fit and design problems. Speaking at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, Rubin said, “We’re purely doing exactly as we’ve been told, and we’ve been told we’re doing everything exactly right." Since reporting to spring training this month, some players have complained about the fit of their new uniforms. The white pants worn by some teams are also see-through enough to clearly show tucked-in jersey tops. State The CDC has relaxed COVID guidelines. Will schools and day cares follow suit? By BIANCA VÁZQUEZ TONESS and MORIAH BALINGIT - AP Education WritersUpdated Mar 1, 2024 Four years after the COVID-19 pandemic closed schools, the CDC says parents can start treating the virus like other respiratory illnesses. Gone are mandated isolation periods and masking. Now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says children can go back to school when their overall symptoms improve and they’re fever-free for 24 hours without taking medication. Students are “encouraged” to wear a mask upon returning. Still, the change may not affect how individual schools urge parents to react when their children fall sick. Schools and child care providers have a mixed record on following CDC recommendations and often look to local authorities for the ultimate word. State Lobster catch dips to lowest level since 2009 as fishers grapple with climate change, whale rules By PATRICK WHITTLE - Associated PressUpdated Mar 1, 2024 America’s lobster fishing business dipped in catch while grappling with challenges including a changing ocean environment and new rules designed to protect rare whales.
