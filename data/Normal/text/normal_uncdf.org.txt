UN Capital Development Fund September 4 1 0 Share [This webinar recording is from 18 July 2023] Zambia's digital finance sector has grown in the last five years: there are more digital finance providers, there are more products and services and higher activity rates. But what does the fintech space look like? How many fintech businesses are operational in Zambia? What does investment in the fintech sector look like?

UN Capital Development Fund August 30 1 0 Share [This is a webinar recording from 27 July 2023.] The gender gap in the adoption of fintech and digital remittances is significant. Recent research by UNCDF indicates that six (6) out of 10 remittance recipients are women, however, only four (4) out of 10 recipients registered to use digital remittances constitute women. Women often rely on more expensive, less secure, and sometimes slower cash-based methods of remittances, citing concerns about safety and distrust of digital options. This has a significant and long-term impact on the financial health of women remittance customers and their families, which also dampens the development potential of global remittance flows. As part of UNCDF‚Äôs Gender Collaborative for Remittances (Gender Colab series), this webinar explored different and complementary approaches to catalyzing innovation in gender-smart remittances. Speakers from UNCDF, Roots of Impact, and Women's World Banking presented from their areas of work and discussed powerful enabling factors that support innovation in meeting the needs of women remittance customers. #migrantmoney¬© UN Capital Development Fund 2023.

UN Capital Development Fund July 26 0 0 Share Statement by David Jackson @LDC5 in Doha during plenary session on 8th March 2023 LoCAL, Financing Locally Led Adaptation: The impact of climate change is acutely experienced at the local level ‚Äì where we work, go to school and live our lives. In the world‚Äôs most climate-vulnerable nations, adaptation is critical and all too often, under-resourced. The UN Capital Development Fund designed the Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility over ten years ago to channel finance to local government authorities and their communities to cover the additional costs of mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change, thereby averting or minimising potential loss and damage. Today, LoCAL is a country-owned mechanism and international standard (ISO 14093:2022) being implemented, or designed for implementation, in over 30 countries across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Pacific.
