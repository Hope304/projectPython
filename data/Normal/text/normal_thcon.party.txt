More information to come, stay tuned! The CTF Like the three previous editions, we will again organize a "Capture The Flag". In that competition, players have to put their hacking skills into practice to solve cybersecurity challenges, like exploiting a flaw in a website, extracting data embedded in a memory image, finding vulnerabilities in an encryption protocol and much moreâ€¦ The resolution of each challenge gives you a "flag", a password needed to win points. The goal, as you might have guessed, is simply to score as much points as possible. This CTF will take place during the Saturday that follows the talks, and the organization is yet to be seen. More information will come on our social networks. INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE In the last few editions, the CTF in hybrid face-to-face and distance learning format has captivated passionate and professional participants from all over the world! 600+ participants 12 countries 4 continents This is partly due to the sponsorship of two international cybersecurity challenge platforms : Prizes The winning teams will win fancy prizes such as hacker equipment, t-shirts and many other surprises!
