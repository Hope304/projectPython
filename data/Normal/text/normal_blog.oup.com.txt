Read More Faith in God, themselves, and the people: Black religious activist-educators By Almeda M. WrightI started my first seminar on Radical Pedagogy, reflecting with students on a provocative blog entitled “10 Reasons Septima Clark was a Badass Teacher.” Beyond the shock value of using badass in a divinity school setting, the students were curious about why I started with this lesser known (if not completely unknown) figure from the 1950s Civil Rights era. Read More The first women’s shelter in Europe? Radegund’s Holy Cross By E.T.

Read More Of language, brain health, and global inequities By Adolfo M. GarcíaOne of the greatest public health challenges of our century lies in the growth of neurodegenerative disorders.

Everything said there about this idiom, its use, the puzzling reference to Indian, as well as about a desired replacement of Indian by a word devoid of ethnic connotations and about the synonyms for the phrase in the languages of the world, is correct. Read More Aleph-AI: an organizing force or creative destruction in the artificial era? By Gissel VelardeThe Aleph is a blazing space of about an inch diameter containing the cosmos, tells us Jorge Luis Borges in 1945, after being invited to see it in the basement of a house.
