But much of that process is obscured behind thick clouds of dust that visible light telescopes cannot penetrate. Spitzer’s infrared detectors were designed to see deeply into these star-forming regions, and reveal these dark dust clouds as glowing nebulae.

The very expansion of space expands this ancient light, shifting what was once visible to our eyes ever farther into the infrared spectrum. Spitzer was built to give us a way to capture this light from galaxies that formed and grew when the universe was young.

The study reveals the existence of long filamentary structures of gas and dust which move in a spiral starting at a distance from the black hole and ending up at the black hole itself. The results, which have been published in the Astrophysical Journal, were obtained using images from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes.
