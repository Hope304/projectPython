TrustRadiusMost Loved Award TrustRadiusBest Feature Set Award TrustRadiusBest Usability Award TrustRadiusBest Customer Support Award G2 Leaders Fall Award “Ten Best Support Sites” by the Association of Support Professionals Progress included in Three Gartner Magic Quadrants Telerik is the Winner of 2 Forbes Business Awards 275K+ customers 3.6M+ developers 400+ awards What Developers Say Using Telerik UI, we were able to boost our speed to production by over 50%. The ability to create rich, interactive UI's without the hassle of rolling our own controls has been incredibly valuable. It should also be noted that Telerik's online documentation is rich with examples, tutorials, and real-working demos. When using competing products, I found their example's to be demo-ware, and not as easily converted to actual production-ready solutions. Jerry Sevier Enterprise Architect, Chaparral Energy Telerik has rich collection of components that enables developers to build fully functional and great looking web applications in a matter of days, which used to be weeks and months without Telerik. On top of that, an aggressive release cycle and very responsive support makes it one of the best investments we've made. Nishant Agarwal Lead Developer, American Express With new controls being released every quarter, the value we get from our DevCraft Complete subscription is great. Telerik support is unsurpassed, with support forums for instant answers and an excellent ticketing system for the odd occasion when we need a little more hand-holding.
