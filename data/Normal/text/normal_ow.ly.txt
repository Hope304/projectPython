It allows you to shorten links for free as you compose and plan posts in the Hootsuite dashboard. Each link can be customized with the tracking parameters needed to monitor success using the analytics tools you know and love, like Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics.You’ve probably seen Ow.ly links while scrolling your own social media feeds. That’s because Ow.ly is one of the most popular web link shorteners out there. When you see one of your favorite brands sharing a post with an Ow.ly link, that means they use Hootsuite to trim links and track their social performance. (Those geniuses!).What is link shortening?Link shortening is a neater, smarter way to share URLs linked in social media posts or profiles. A URL shortener trims and tidies links so they don’t take up as much precious caption space. Users are still directed to the original link destination, but they won’t have to waste time copy-and-pasting a long, complicated URL.Why shorten URLs?All social networks have character limits, and lengthy links can eat into them quickly. On top of that, many social media platforms don’t allow you to put hyperlinks in captions. That means that users have to copy the URL text and paste it into their browser to navigate to the page you’re sharing. Or worse: type it out by hand.Not only does shortening lengthy URLs with the Ow.ly link shortener help you tidy up your posts and track performance, but it can also boost your credibility on social media. Long links look spammy and untrustworthy, so people are less likely to click on them. Plus, vanity URLs can help boost brand awareness and keep your business top-of-mind.What does a link shortener do?Hootsuite’s link shortener does more than just truncate links so they look nicer in your social posts.
