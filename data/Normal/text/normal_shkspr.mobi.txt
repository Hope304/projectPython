Fresh from winning some dance show on linear-TV and ready to... well, do the same thing as he's been doing for years.

There's an odd […]Continue reading →O2 UK's Weird MSISDN Lookup APIBy @edent · CyberSecurity gdpr o2 privacy security · 8 comments · 250 words · read ~143 times.It's always fun keeping your network inspector tab open.

Try it for yourself - stick a €20 note into your nearest Xerox machine and try to print […]Continue reading →Movie Review: M*A*S*H★★☆☆☆By @edent · Movie Review · 5 comments · 350 wordsAfter watching the First few series of the TV show "M*A*S*H", I thought I'd give the original movie a go. It isn't very good. Even if you ignore the rampant racism - and there is a lot of racism - you still have to content with the brutal misogyny - and it is toe-curlingly grim.

But this benefits no-one. This is my situation - it's probably different to yours. I'm acutely aware I'm in a better financial position than most.
