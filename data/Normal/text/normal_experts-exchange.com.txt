Not only does this make it easier to network with other professionals - but also makes working together much easier because people have invested in a membership. While there are other free communities out there - EE members prefer this one because of the way that our members treat each other. Unlike free communities - you won’t get a condescending answer if you ask a simple question. Additionally - the EE organization is a small business that relies 100% on membership fees for support. We’re completely ad-free and vendor free, and we don’t sell any private data.What do I get with a membership?When you sign up for an EE membership, you're getting immediate and unlimited access to all content site wide, including question threads, private groups, articles, 1:1 direct messaging, and more. Membership also comes with the ability to ask unlimited questions of your own, one of the best ways to interact with other members. Do I have to pay when I want a question answered?No way! Your membership fee gives you unlimited access to the entire platform and all of the features that come with it. Obviously, we can’t completely guarantee that you’ll get the perfect answer to every single question you ask - that depends on the people answering! However - questions on EE are rarely neglected. Chances are, if you ask a clear and respectful question, it will receive the attention it deserves.Are there alternative/international payment methods?Yes! We support payment via PayPal as well as multiple different international currencies. If you have any questions about payment or billing, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Our customer support team would be happy to work together in order to make sure you’re able to pay in a way that is comfortable and convenient for you. What is an Expert?Individuals who earn Expert status on EE have been through an extensive verification process designed to ensure that the information and insights they share are trustworthy. While anyone can earn Expert status, Experts are typically IT veterans with more than a decade of experience in their field - and many have earned statuses such as Microsoft MVP.Our organization deals with private data. Is it safe?The safety and privacy of our members is our top priority. Our revenue model allows us to be ad free so we don’t have to sell customer data to advertisers. The EE organization is a small business too - sometimes we joke that even if we did steal data - we wouldn’t know what to do with it. We also offer data obfuscation tools in our Q&A feature in case someone in your organization has an on-site question concerning private company data.Our CompanyAbout UsOur CompanyContact UsCareersTerms of UseExpert OfficePrivacy PolicyResourcesTopicsPricingContact SalesEE vs StackCredly PartnershipCommunityEE for TeamsEE for SMBEE for EnterpriseRebirth Event RecapHistoryPodcastCertified Expert ProgramGuest Pass ProgramSocialLinkedinTwitterFacebookInstagram
