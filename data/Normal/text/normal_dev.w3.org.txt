W3C Public CVS Repository W3C Public CVS Repository This is an WWW interface to the W3C public CVS tree, available under the W3C Software License. Important: Direct CVS access to the W3C public CVS tree has been discontinued on April 1st, 2019. The web interface for read-only perusing will continue to be available. The repositories that are still active were migrated to other platforms such as W3C's github repository. You can browse the file hierarchy by following directory links (which have slashes after them, e.g. src/). If you follow a link to a file, you will see its revision history. Following a link labeled with a revision number will display that revision of the file. In the revision history view, there is a link near each revision to display diffs between that revision and the previous one, and a form at the bottom of the page that allows you to display diffs between arbitrary revisions. Please contact the Systems Team for access problems. CVS Root: [Public] Module path or alias: File Rev.
