In the US, the P1000 is out of stock/back-ordered at B&H Photo and Adorama. Amazon seems to have only refurbished/gray market P100 cameras. WEX UK and Foto Erhardt DE also show the P1000 as discontinued. The P1000 was announced back in 2018. I strongly believe Nikon will release a new version of this model since the P1000 has been extremely popular for birds photography.
