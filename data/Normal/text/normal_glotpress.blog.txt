Since then, we have added a lot of functionalities to GlotPress, and we have released 11 alpha versions. In this post, I set the 4.0 release schedule: January 25, 2024 – Beta (4.0.0-beta.1 and 4.0.0-beta.2 already released). February 26, 2024 – Release Candidate. March 7, 2024 – Final release, trying to do it in the Contributor Day at WordCamp Asia 2024. The current list and status of 4.0 issues and pull requests is available on GitHub. Feel free to drop by our Slack channel (#glotpress) during our weekly office hours (or any other time) if you have any questions or input to these or anything else. GlotPress 4.0 will introduce several significant features, and we encourage everyone to try out the beta when it is released, especially those that have built plugins or custom themes, as both may require changes to be compatible with the release. #release Jesús Amieiro 1:29 pm on April 18, 2023 Tags: biweekly meetings ( 25 ), meeting ( 17 ), weekly meetings ( 24 ) Agenda: Monthly GlotPress Chat – April 19, 2023 (8:00 UTC) Here’s the agenda for our monthly chat (each 4 weeks).
