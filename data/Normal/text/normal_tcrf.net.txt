The Cutting Room Floor From The Cutting Room Floor Jump to navigation Jump to search Welcome to The Cutting Room Floor. 28,220 articles and counting! The Cutting Room Floor is a site dedicated to unearthing and researching unused and cut content from video games. From debug menus, to unused music, graphics, enemies, or levels, many games have content never meant to be seen by anybody but the developers — or even meant for everybody, but cut due to time/budget constraints. Feel free to browse our collection of games and start reading. Up for research? Try looking at some stubs and see if you can help us out.

If you want to help keep this site running and help further research into games, feel free to donate. Suggestions?
