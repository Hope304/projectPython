We offer more than 60 different website apps that integrate with 70+ platforms such as Shopify, Wix, BigCommerce, Squarespace, Joomla, and more, or can be added directly to an HTML website. No coding is required. Ever. Our apps are trusted on over 12 million websites worldwide to collect more leads and boost your conversions. We are headquartered in San Francisco, CA, with offices in Almaty, KZ, and a dedicated global team. What is a website app?A website app, or web application, is an added website component that performs some function for the end-user, such as a newsletter or blog subscription, a popup advertising a discount or sale, along with any number of other functions. You must first have a live website developed and managed via a website builder such as Wix or WordPress or an online ECommerce store such as Shopify or BigCommerce. All of POWR’s 60+ website apps do not require coding or the assistance of a web developer or programmer.Is there a difference between a website app and a plugin?Not to be confused with mobile apps on your smartphone, website apps or plugins are essentially the same in that they are both add-ons to an already existing website that improves your site’s functionality and user experience. The term “add-ons” has been universally used to describe all website apps, plugins, widgets, or extensions. Naming conventions can also be traced to your internet service provider (ISP) or your preferred website builder. Widgets are oft-used synonymously with web apps and plugins, although there are some subtle differences. The main difference is widgets typically only appear in certain sections of your website, such as your top navigation bar or the footer, whereas a website app can appear anywhere. Our unified name at POWR is “Apps,” but be aware that they are, in fact, plugins or widgets in the traditional sense. Considering we integrate with virtually every website builder, you can call them whatever you like!How much do POWR apps cost?Any or all POWR apps can be free for life; it depends on what functionality and limitations you choose or need. For example, you can upgrade to our Starter tier for only a few dollars per month. Additionally, you can select annual billing instead of monthly, and receive a deeper discount. All access can be found on our Business tier where you can gain the functionality of every POWR app's upgraded features for one low monthly or annual price.
