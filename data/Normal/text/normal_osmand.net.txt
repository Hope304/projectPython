The various topo layers in OsmAnd help me understand the terrain. Further, the wide range of plugins (contour lines, hill shades, slopes, Open Street Map editing) has made OsmAnd my daily driver for hiking and trail running. The map markers and OSM Notes help me plan my week long hiking traverses and I can also overlay digitised maps for cross referencing. I also use the desktop editor to map hiking routes, high altitude glacial lake, mountain passes, peaks, and POIs (spring, shelters, waterfalls, cairn, campsites etc).May 11, 2022James Avery@google-playMuch better than Google Maps for navigating by foot or by bike. User submissions makes all the little paths available, and makes sure that they are actually usable (or they wouldn't have been submitted). Offline maps work really well, too, even in back country. I always make sure to download the region if I plan to go hiking. Only downside compared to Google Maps is the user interface for navigation, which could still use some work. Wonderful project!June 1, 2021Jan I≈Çowski@app-storeBest maps application for privacy, however the UI could use some work The idea of computing all the routes on my device locally is absolutely wonderful. The app has great functions overall, however it has a steep learning curve. I could see many people used to Google/Apple Maps struggle to make the switch because of convenience, even if OSM offers superior functionality and more precise information.Jule 15, 2021Gionata Nencinipartireper.itOsmAnd+ opened to me and to my community/customers the freedom of discovery and scouting we had never experienced before on a motorcycle. I adore and support OsmAnd+ and talk about it during rides I lead, events I organize, books I write, tutorial I executes and workshops I run at Motoviaggio Store. Really glad to be an ambassador for this powerful and useful tool every traveler should have on their devices. Keep up the great work!May 4, 2022bestapp.comwww.bestapp.comIf you‚Äôre concerned about online privacy, then you‚Äôll want to be especially careful when choosing a navigation app. After all, for these apps to function you‚Äôll need to at least share your location, and you may find yourself sharing other personal details as well. OsmAnd is open-source navigation app and has particularly strong privacy policies ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt collect user data, and let you decide exactly what the app has access to.April 20, 2022Matias Lavik@google-playIf you're a little bit technical then this could really be the best map app for walking around in cities. It has *a lot* of details, such as benches, playgrounds, parks, wheelchair accessibility and various info about stores and restaurants, such as WiFi access. The map rendering looks great, and it's easy to see where you can find grass and parks, etc.April 18, 2022TwitterPollOsmAnd PollOsmAndPurchases üí≥Map üåçDocsMap legendDownloadsBuild itGiveawayAboutCommunityGitHub DiscussionsTwitterRedditFacebookTelegram ChannelMatrixTelegram chatEnglishFrenchGermanItalianUkrainianPolishRussianSpanishArabicT√ºrk√ßeMoreBlogGitHubOsmAnd CZ ManualsGet OsmAnd MerchandiseSupportCopyright ¬© 2024 OsmAnd BV.
