A 'Historian' is a special user type for people who do a significant amount of research to document concerts. As such, they may not have attended all of the concerts that are listed on their profile. To reward their effort, Historians get an ad-free experience on Concert Archives and we have plans for additional perks in the future. We also feature a random Historian on the homepage.
