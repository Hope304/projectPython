Contributions from many parties have enabled and benefitted the creation of the HTML edition of The Feynman Lectures on Physics. We wish to thank Carver Mead, for his warm encouragement and generous financial support, without which this edition would have been impossible, Thomas Kelleher and Basic Books, for their open-mindedness in allowing this edition to be published free of charge, Adam Cochran, for tying up the many slippery loose ends that needed to come together in order for this edition to be realized, Alan Rice for his steadfast enthusiasm for this project, and for rallying the support of Caltech's Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy.
