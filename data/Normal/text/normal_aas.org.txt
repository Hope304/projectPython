There are certain craters at the Moon's north and south poles that sunlight never directly touches, creating an environment where ice can form. Recently, scientists used simulated lunar surface materials to understand how ice can reshape tiny grains of lunar soil and potentially create fine dust that could be unhealthy for future lunar astronauts. To learn more about this research, you can read our AAS Nova highlight and the corresponding research article in the Planetary Science Journal.
