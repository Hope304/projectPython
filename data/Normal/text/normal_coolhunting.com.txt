Paul Stolper Gallery Brian Eno’s Turntable II, 2024 £20,000.00 Paul Stolper Gallery Brian Eno’s Turntable II, 2024 £20,000.00 Brian Eno has released his next generation light art turntable following the success of his first in 2021, which achieved cult status and became the muse for U2’s mind-blowing show at The Sphere. Similar in concept, Turntable II, 2024 is a fully functional, audiophile turntable featuring a Pro-Ject tonearm, Ortofon cartridge, belt-drive motor and gold plated RCA connectors. The body is made of a single resin block with a frosted cast acrylic cover, and it features a control board and Arduino chip that powers the ever-changing dopamine inducing show of colors. Handmade in the UK, it’s available in an edition of 150 pieces and 20 artist proofs.

Limited to 100 pieces each, the classic model is available in either a Center Seconds or Sub-Seconds edition. Sleek, simple, elegant, not flashy, it’s a great daily driver and one that doesn’t bring too much attention to your wrist (in all the right ways). Inspired by Braun’s AW10 and AW50 watches, the stainless steel watch is 40mm.
