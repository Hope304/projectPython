It's an engaging way to explore our society, culture and gender politics. This asks questions you didn't know you had. And I loved every minute.” Kris • Anderson's Bookshop “The art world is wack, and this book is a fascinating look at it. Bosker is a fantastic narrator; thoroughly engaging. Highly recommend this one!” Melissa • Watermark Books “Not your typical paranormal romance, but just as deliciously addictive, wonderfully spicy, and filled with the best parts of vampire romances (vamp bites!) and shifter romances (fated mates and knotty fun!). This book was so good! I had a smile on my face the whole time while reading. I love a good paranormal romance, especially with the twist of werewolf species dominance and a fantastic villain monolog. Misery and Lowe forever! <3 I like Ali Hazelwood's STEM romances a lot.... but I'm...” Anna Rose • The Well-Read Moose “Wow Wow Wow!! I love this book so much! I love the chaotic and messy crew of the Ambit, with its snarky, lovable AI captain, grumpy war vet, pragmatic and witty engineer, and secret-cinnamon-roll stowaway soldier. This book is packed with non-stop action, great banter, found family, and a space saga shootout that will have you laughing and crying. I couldn't get enough of this book! I listened to the audiobook on Libro.fm. Great audiobook! Torian Brackett does a fantastic job at voice acting...” Anna Rose • The Well-Read Moose “This is a beautiful exploration of humanity from the most zoomed out view possible - space! I loved the lyrical writing style and the way it made me think about the world. If you ever need to be reminded of the bigger picture, this is the book to read. ” Becca • Bookmarks “Howl’s Moving Castle but make it a spooky Polish forest. So great! ” Chelsea • Sidetrack Bookshop Indie Press Audiobooks 2024 Women’s Prize for Non-Fiction Longlist 2023 National Book Critics Circle Finalists Hot New Releases Indie Press Audiobooks 2024 Women’s Prize for Non-Fiction Longlist 2023 National Book Critics Circle Finalists Hot New Releases Playlists made by humans, not bots Curated by Libro.fm staff & booksellers across the globe.
