Because today, Hart is releasing a new EP/mixtape called “Reality Burger With A Side Of Life” as a free download. As he explains in a statement: “I put out my last actual record in 2010 and never stopped making music, doing it for fun makes the music infinitely more satisfying. I have hundreds of unfinished songs and these are the ones that seemed to deserve my attention. I’ve always loved making sample-based music and this project is a snapshot of what I get up to on most nights with my sampler. I’ve always wanted the Russian Futurists to be the sound of me with too many drinks etc. in my system in my basement; the distillation of Eric B. & Rakim, the Alchemist, and the Cocteau Twins all hanging out around a bunch of dusty records.” The EP is a 16 minute, seven track banger, plus a collaboration with fellow Toronto producer Swim Good Now. As promised, it’s The Russian Futurists as sampledelia, with Hart piling his usual exuberant hooks atop a patchwork of older soul, R&B, and pop songs.
