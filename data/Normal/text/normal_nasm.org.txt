Why NASM? “ Being a personal trainer changed my life in so many ways. I get to do what I love. I get to change people's lives. I get to help create awareness, inspire, motivate and I get to be that person for them. Annie M. | NASM Master Instructor “ I help clients achieve their fitness goals by complimenting their nutrition. It's definitely a tangible benefit I see. This is my happiness because I feel fulfilled as a personal trainer and a nutrition coach. Yulibeth L. | NASM CPT and CNC “ Why NASM? Because I believe is the easiest, most effective, most robust way to learn the material you're going to need to better another individual's life. Jake Olson | Former USC football player, NASM CES, NASM GFS, motivational speaker “ NASM has provided me with the knowledge that I need to be a confident trainer and I think that shines through when you meet new people and new clients, that you're confident in your craft. Cornelia H. | NASM CPT “ When you are training, you spend every day on your schedule, having as much fun as you want, working as hard as you want, to me that's freedom. To me, that's me running my own business, and doing it the way I want to do it. Jordan T. | NASM CPT “ My dream is to reach out to as many people as I can. Inspiring them to live healthier lifestyles. I love challenging people and then seeing them overcome their challenges, that makes me so happy.
