It's what I use, and free." Edward Snowden, whistleblower and privacy advocate "SecureDrop depends on Qubes OS for best-in-class isolation of sensitive workloads on journalist workstations. Providing journalists with a sane way to handle untrusted content from unknown sources is part of our job, and Qubes gives us the tools we need to do that job well." Freedom of the Press Foundation, non-profit dedicated to supporting free speech and public-interest journalism "When I use Qubes I feel like a god. Software thinks that it's in control, that it can do what it wants? It can't. I'm in control." Micah Lee, Director of Information Security at The Intercept, advisor to DDoSecrets "Qubes OS gives us greater confidence in the security of systems being used to remotely access our servers, mainly because powerful physical and logical privilege separation between workspaces allows our engineers to select appropriate degrees of isolation for different processes."
