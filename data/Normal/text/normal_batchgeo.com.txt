Map style See your map below. If you find any markers out of place - just drag and drop them to the correct location. Attention! The following addresses are outside of the recommended boundaries: The addresses below could not be mapped: Addresses should resemble physical locations (addresses, postal codes, cities, etc.) To correct this issue, you may want to fix these in your source data or make sure you have proper columns selected in Step #2 or, if you are not already, try using our spreadsheet template. If the above looks incorrect, choose the option to keep all your markers below. If not, discard your markers and continue.

From spreadsheet to map in three simple steps 1. Copy your data From spreadsheets, to tables in web pages, databases—anywhere you can visualize a table with location data you can map multiple locations with BatchGeo. If you are starting from scratch, we recommend using our Spreadsheet Template to get started with your data, then simply copy the data over to BatchGeo to create a pin map. 2. Set options We make our best guess at your intended columns like the address, city, state, zip code, or latitude / longitude. You may want to set the options yourself if you don't like the default behavior. 3. Map Addresses We plot your postcodes / addresses and make your multi pin map. It may take a few minutes depending on how many addresses you have, if you already had latitude and longitude in your data it will map instantly. After you are done mapping the addresses you can save to a web page using the "Continue & Save" option. 93,466 Active Users 17,828,312 Google Maps Created 1,282,595 Live Maps Used by Get more with Pro Street View Integration Heat Map Layer No Ads Multi Point Routing 10 Users Included Advanced Features Enhanced Security Advanced Data Selection More Data & Groups Get Started Sales Mapping Map customers, leads, suppliers, and more using our tools.
