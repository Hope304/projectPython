David Gerard's home page David Gerard I'm most active at the moment on my blockchain blog, and on Rocknerd, my music webzine. I have books! Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, an acerbic history and survey of Bitcoin, blockchains and smart contracts, as ebook and paperback. And, of course, the blog of the same name, covering blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Libra Shrugged: How Facebook Tried to Take Over the Money, the story of Facebook's attempt to do a cryptocurrency called Libra, and how it crashed and burned. I casually social-media on Mastodon. Other stuff I do and have done. I'm an Australian living in London with spouse and child. Here's the loved one's art page. You should buy a design! Or one of their records! Photo Â©2014 Keith Marshall
