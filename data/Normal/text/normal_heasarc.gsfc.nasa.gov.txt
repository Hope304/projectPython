Since its merger with the Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis (LAMBDA) in 2008, the HEASARC archive contains data obtained by high-energy astronomy missions observing in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), X-ray, and gamma-ray bands, as well as data from space missions, balloons, and ground-based facilities that have studied the relic cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in the sub-mm, mm and cm bands. The HEASARC is a member of the NASA Astronomical Virtual Observatories (NAVO) where we work with other NASA archives to ensure comprehensive and consistent VO access to NASA mission datasets. Users may now query the HEASARC's catalogs using VO-enabled services and specialized tools. This page describes how to get to the HEASARC VO-enabled services and provides information on other HEASARC VO activities.
