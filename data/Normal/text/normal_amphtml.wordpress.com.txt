For most of us, not much has changed in email functionality since the first time we were introduced to email. Because AMP is inherently fast and secure, we brought AMP technology to email in order to give users an interactive, real-time experience that also keeps inboxes safe. AMP now enables all-new email experiences like being able to submit RSVPs to events, fill out questionnaires, browse catalogs, or respond to comments right within the email. Emails can also stay up to date, displaying the freshest content from comment threads or the latest recommendations. Dynamic email built using AMP by Ecwid Bringing AMP emails to major email providers The AMP for email spec has engagement from major email providers around the world including Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook.com, and Mail.Ru. As each of these providers launches support, senders will scale the reach of their AMP emails to users. After a developer preview with top email senders, Gmail is launching general availability of AMP for Email today. You can head to the Gmail blog to see some illustrative examples of the email recipient experience. You can also check out these provider specific pages for additional information: Yahoo MailOutlook.comMail.Ru We aim to provide the highest quality email experiences for our consumers and we are excited to be one of the first providers to participate in the AMP for email spec. This allows us to enable fast, responsive, and high-performing experiences right within email.– Marcel Becker, Director Product Management for Yahoo Mail If you develop an email provider and would like to consider adding AMP for email support, you can find more information here. Start creating AMP emails today Email senders can begin creating AMP emails by using the playground which allows you to edit markup and see real-time changes to your email. For more information about the supported features and syntax, head over to amp.dev. It’s important to note that some providers may have sender whitelists that limit who is eligible to send AMP emails, so be sure to register with providers if that’s the case. If you rely on a third party for your emails, please ensure they have AMP support. The following email products already support the AMP spec or in the process of launching support soon: SparkPost, an email delivery and analytics platformLitmus, an email design and marketing tools suiteTwilio Sendgrid, an email platform for transactional and marketing emails that is used by over 80,000 companies.Amazon SES and Amazon Pinpoint, cloud-based email sending and analytics services for transactional and marketing emailsMore are in progress, so contact your email service providers to find out if they support AMP email AMP emails are designed to be compatible in the current email ecosystem with the introduction of a new MIME part. This design allows emails to fall back to HTML if a provider or email client doesn’t support AMP emails yet—learn more about the spec and recommended guidelines. New AMP email working group To make AMP the best user-friendly email experience, we need your help to contribute to its direction. This is why we created the AMP for email working group under AMP’s governance model, a way to channel feedback from senders and providers to support ongoing spec improvements. The two goals of this group are to: Increase email provider knowledge sharing to promote higher cross-provider compatibility of sender emailsChannel community feedback to senders and providers to support ongoing innovation of the spec If you are an email provider, sender or would simply like to get involved in the AMP for Email working group, you can file discussion issues on the ampproject/wg-amp4email repositoryor come chat with us at #wg-amp4email on Slack. With the email spec being open source, strong multi-vendor support, a gradual migration strategy, and an open working group to have everyone’s voice heard, we’re looking forward to building a better email experience for everyone. We look forward to your involvement! Posted by Vamsee Jasti, Product Manager, AMP Project Building the future of email with AMP Announcing the AMP Conf Lineup! March 11, 2019 amphtml Earlier this year we shared that AMP Conf 2019 will bring together the AMP community again this year in Tokyo on April 17-18. After over 70 talk submissions (thank you!), we’ve put together an extensive agenda at this year’s event. From learning about the potential for AMP stories in emerging markets, to allowing custom Javascript to run on an AMP page (crazy right!?), we hope you’re as excited as we are for this year’s lineup. And with the addition of AMP’s new governance, we’ll also hear for the first time from the Technical Steering Committee on their vision for the future of the project. This year’s line-up includes: The glory of amp-script: Unleashing the krakenKristofer Baxter, GoogleGrowing Up AMP First: Everything I Know I Learned From AMPMelissa, Depuydt, WaPoAMP Stories: The Story so farJon Newmuis & Wei Hong, GoogleNo power, no internet, no support: How AMP bridges the “app gap” in Iraq and other war-impacted regionsLevi Clancy, Re:Coded & Balla Khadang, YouGovAdvertising & AMP: Driving ROI with speedVamsee Jasti & Katharina Familia Almonte, GoogleProviding AMP service to tens of thousands of ecommerce sitesTommy Kang & Jinhyoung Kil, Cafe24 Check out the agenda in full on our site. We still have a few spots remaining if you’d like to join us in person! Please apply here. Otherwise, all the talks will be live streamed and recorded on our YouTube channel. We look forward to seeing you in Tokyo next month! Posted by Matt Ludwig, AMP Marketing Lead at Google Announcing the AMP Conf Lineup! Encouraging more voices in AMP March 6, 2019 amphtml Last year we implemented changes in AMP’s governance model to encourage a wider variety of voices in the AMP community and to make it more clear how people can have a voice. I’m happy to provide some updates on our progress towards these goals. AMP’s Technical Steering Committee and Advisory Committee have started meeting As part of AMP’s new governance model the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) sets AMP’s product and technical direction and the Advisory Committee (AC) provides advice to the TSC. With these two groups we have representatives from nearly 20 companies & open web advocates helping to guide the AMP community towards our vision of “a strong, user-first open web forever.” The TSC has now had several meetings, covering a range of topics from GitHub repository best practices to what AMP’s first set of Working Groups should be. The AC also had their first meeting where they kicked off a conversation regarding horizontal reviews, a topic on which the TSC has asked for input. If you have something you’d like to raise with one of these committees, you’ll find out how to do this in their “working mode” documents (TSC, AC). Working Groups are ready for you to get involved One of the TSC’s first acts was to establish the initial set of AMP Working Groups (WGs). Working Groups are where the day-to-day work in AMP gets done. A Working Group is responsible for a certain part of AMP, such as the Stories WG, which is responsible for AMP’s story format. The Working Groups are intended to make it easier for people to keep track of different parts of AMP and to get involved. To help with this, each Working Group has a GitHub repository that documents how to get updates on the Working Group’s work and how to get involved–from participating in discussions on issues and Slack to contributing bug fixes, features or other improvements. I encourage you to find the Working Groups responsible for the areas you’re passionate about and to get involved! We’ve made our process for making changes to AMP more clear Although we’ve always said we strongly encourage contributions to AMP, we’ve heard it can be challenging to figure out the process for proposing and making changes and even to know where to get help. Due to this feedback we’ve been working to improve and clarify the process for making changes in AMP, inspired by Chromium’s process for launching features. Some of the highlights of these updates: We’ve made it more clear that small changes are easy to make without a lot of process overhead.We’ve added a slightly more formal launch process for significant changes, including the use of Intent-to-implement (I2I) and Intent-to-ship (I2S) issues and a more well-defined way of getting approval for making significant changes.We’ve made it easier to find a reviewer who can help you through the process of getting your change built and launched. With AMP’s new governance model and contribution process updates in place we hope it’s easier than ever for you to stay up-to-date on what’s happening in AMP and to get involved! Posted by Joey Rozier, AMP Engineering Manager at Google Encouraging more voices in AMP Welcome to the AMP Roadshow 2019. First stop: Africa! March 5, 2019 amphtml Posted by Ben Morss, Developer Advocate at Google In 2017, we started the AMP Roadshow to educate and meet developers around the world. The Roadshow is a free one-day hands-on conference and workshop for new developers and seasoned AMP wizards alike, brought to your city. In 2018, the AMP team visited 21 cities in 10 countries around the world! In 2019, we’ll be traveling to at least 20 more cities. We’re kicking things off with our very first visit to Africa, including stops in South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya. You’ll find us in cities with established web development communities, but we’ll be increasing our efforts to go to places with newer web developers. We’ll be showing off all of AMP’s new advanced features, but we also want to meet programmers and site owners who are newer to the web. We think AMP is a great place to start! Consequently we’ll be adding more chances to build your first AMP site, ask questions, and give us feedback. And we’ll feature new talks and demos as the year goes on. We’ll add more destinations throughout the year. In the meantime, you can sign up now for the following events: JohannesburgCape TownLagosNairobi We can’t wait to meet you all in person. Come say hello! Welcome to the AMP Roadshow 2019. First stop: Africa! What’s new in AMP, Q1 2019: Improvements to consent, videos, forms and lists February 27, 2019February 27, 2019 amphtml Video improvements We have all experienced a situation where we want to watch a video and the related notes simultaneously. Good examples are a video of a recipe along with the instructions, or a video along with its transcript. The dock attribute on <amp-video> now supports minimizing the video to the corner of the viewport when the user scrolls. Developers can also customize where and how the video docks. We also launched <amp-video-iframe>, which allows developers to include a custom-built video player that will obtain all the features available in the AMP Video Interface (e.g. autoplay, dock, etc.) Tasty.co uses <amp-video-iframe> for their video recipes. Their custom player loops the video between a predefined start and end time. This allows them to use one video for different recipes by only seeking to the relevant segment of the video in each recipe. Increased engagement and better resize with <amp-list> <amp-list> now also allows developers to specify when they want the container to resize on user interaction, for e.g, when the <amp-list> contains an <amp-accordion> that a user taps on. Additionally, we are experimentally adding infinite scroll capabilities to the component, so when the user reaches the end of a list of items (search results, product cards, etc), the list is populated with more items. A huge shout out to Chris Papazian from the Pinterest team for kicking this off. The AMP UI Working Group picked this up from Chris’ initial work and is excited to see this feature enabled in AMP to help publishers’ increase engagement! Input masking in forms To help make the task of filling in forms a bit easier, we’ve enabled input masking. This allows developers to add formatting like spaces and interstitial characters, which helps users fill out forms more efficiently. Dates, payment details and phone numbers are all great examples of inputs that could benefit from input masking. Better transitions in <amp-lightbox-gallery> The AMP UI Working Group has also been working on polishing already launched components to create a more delightful experience for end users. One such example is improved transitions for all images going to and from lightbox mode. This has been a hard problem to solve, as it involves interpolating between two images of different positions and sizes. You can visit our open source animations project for more details. Stay tuned for a technical blogpost that shares more insights into this work. <amp-consent> now supports 3rd party integrations We launched <amp-consent> in AMP a few months ago to simplify how publishers could collect data collection user consent on AMP pages. A number of publishers rely on 3rd party consent management platforms (CMP) to integrate with their web pages to manage consent status across various vendors. AMP now allows CMPs to easily integrate with AMP. If you are a publisher, you can also inline the configuration allowing you to show your own consent UI inside AMP. If you are a CMP, you can find instructions to integrate here. Enhancements to <amp-ima-video> The <amp-ima-video> component provides an easy to monetize publisher video with video ads from any video ad network that supports the IMA SDK. Our big thanks to Rebecca Close, an engineer working at Buzzfeed, who contributed and tested the following updates to the AMP project: Showing video controls on hoverVideo controls during Ad playbackMuting / Unmuting videosReplaying / Looping videosAd X of Y labels with i18n support The best of the rest The <amp-date-display> component renders date information in various date formats and in different locales. A good use case for this is the news ecosystem, where users can see publishing dates for an article in their local time. AMP Stories now support Real Time Config when used with the Google Ad Manager ad implementation, allowing you to enhance the ad request with additional targeting information. Upcoming features worth a shout Below are a few things the AMP team has been working on: A dedicated component for typeahead autocomplete in AMP. If you have any thoughts please file feedback here. A new carousel experience that we are looking to launch soon over the upcoming months.An easy-to-deploy Service Worker library for AMP. You can learn more about it over in its GitHub repo.A component that helps developers integrate reCaptcha v3 on AMP documents. For more details, see the GitHub issue.We have made a number of updates to AMP Stories including support for links in the top 80%, a hamburger menu, hold to pause, a new desktop UI, and attachments. Stay tuned for a full post with updates soon. * * * Thanks to the AMP development community for your work and feedback. As always, please let us know if you have any issues or feature requests. Posted by Naina Raisinghani, Product Manager, AMP Project at Google What’s new in AMP, Q1 2019: Improvements to consent, videos, forms and lists Using AMP to make display ads safer, faster and better for users February 20, 2019 amphtml Editor’s note: The following post was originally published on the Google Ads Blog by Vamsee Jasti, AMP Product Manager at Google. The performance benefits and security guarantees offered by AMPHTML ads, which are display ads created using the AMP framework, translate to better advertiser ROI, publisher revenue and overall better user experience. Because of this, Google has expanded serving AMPHTML ads not only to AMP pages, but also to regular web pages. As of January this year, 12% of all display ads served by Google are now AMPHTML ads. All of the code in the AMP repository is open source which is carefully reviewed by the project maintainers before being merged. As a result, ads written in AMP start performant and stay performant. Such a process also drastically reduces the likelihood of AMPHTML ads having code that takes advantage of chipset level vulnerabilities or drain CPU by crypto-mining from users’ devices. Since AMPHTML ads can be trusted, they can be rendered into a more performant same-origin iframe. This performance boost results in the ad rendering faster on page which translates to higher publisher revenue and better advertiser ROI. Experiment results from GPT.js rendering AMPHTML ads in a same-origin vs cross-origin iframe AMPHTML ads on AMP pages deliver even better ROI An AMPHTML ad delivered to an AMP page has better performance compared to the same ad running on a regular web page. This is due to the inherent design of AMPHTML ads outlined here, giving advertisers better click through rates and viewability. AMP pages have seen steady growth over the past few years and advertisers now have access to well over 1 billion impressions/day worth of premium (from a user experience & ad experience standpoint) inventory. In addition, more than 35 percent of ads served to AMP pages are already AMPHTML ads. Publishers and Advertisers seeing success with AMP pages and AMPHTML ads The news publisher EL PAIS partnered with Volkswagen, one of their advertisers, to run a multivariate A/B test measuring how Volkswagen’s display ads created in AMPHTML vs HTML5 would perform on AMP vs regular pages. Simply moving from a standard HTML page to an AMP page (with the same HTML5 ad) resulted in a 26 percent CTR increase. Moving further to an AMP page with AMPHTML ads resulted in an additional 48 percent CTR increase. Increase in performance metrics when combining AMP pages with AMPHTML ads You can read the full case study here. Getting started with AMPHTML ads for advertisers AMPHTML ads are a subset of the AMP spec and ships with many good-by-default ads UI components, an analytics measurement framework, a spam detection system, viewability measurement and other building blocks to create a good and measurable ad. We encourage you to read more about the benefits of using AMPHTML ads, but if you want to jump ahead to start creating them, this is a good place to begin. Once you have created the ad, you can choose one of the following options to serve AMPHTML ads: Work with an Authorized Buyer that allows to target just AMP or regular inventory Use Google Ads to target inventory in the Google Display NetworkDirect buy with publishers using Google Ad Manager[Coming Soon] Display & Video 360 support to deliver AMPHTML ads to AMP pages Google continues to invest in delivering better user ad experiences by increasing the share of AMPHTML ads vs regular ads. Once mobile app support launches in Q2, 2019, advertisers can fully transition to creating a single AMPHTML ad and have it render across all environments and devices. We hope you’ll take full advantage of the performance, security benefits and the increased ROI by choosing to build & serve AMPHTML ads in your next campaign. Posted by Vamsee Jasti, AMP Product Manager at Google Using AMP to make display ads safer, faster and better for users Volkswagen and EL PAÍS increase conversions by 76% with the first end-to-end AMP campaign February 11, 2019 amphtml Volkswagen, one of the world’s largest automotive companies, sought to improve the user experience of potential customers for their 2019 Tiguan TDI 150 R Line. Given their business goals and desire to test the state-of-the-art in speed and performance, they decided to test AMP technology for both their landing page, and the ad creatives that would drive users there. EL PAÍS, a company within the Prisa Group, is the world’s leading Spanish-language news medium, in its digital format. It has 64.7 million unique users per month worldwide. Digital transformation is key to Prisa’s business, and they maintain a position at the forefront of digital innovation. EL PAÍS was an early adopter of AMP technology, launching their first AMP version of EL PAÍS in 2015. They have been using this technology since then, to serve fast high-quality content to their large audience on mobile. Similarly, EL PAÍS was one of the first adopters globally of AMPHTML ads (ad creatives built with AMP). Objective Many news and entertainment publishers already use AMP to deliver beautiful, fast pages to end users across devices. However, the creatives that serve to these pages are typically built with standard HTML, which tend to result in degraded performance and therefore lower ROI for advertisers. Volkswagen and EL PAÍS, together with the creative agency DDB, media agency PHD, and with the support of Google, have conducted a test to evaluate the benefits of AMPHTML ads. The Test EL PAÍS conducted the experiment by configuring four different line items in their ad server, featuring a 2×2 combination of environment (AMP vs. non-AMP) and creative type (AMPHTML vs. HTML). This allowed them to compare the performance characteristics of the AMPHTML creative and its original HTML equivalent, both in an AMP environment and within traditional mobile Web. Additionally, they tested two flavors of landing pages (HTML and AMP), allowing for a full comparison of results throughout the conversion funnel. Results After collecting data from more than 2M impressions on mobile devices, AMP technology has shown strong performance increases relative to standard HTML: AMP pages and ads versus standard HTML pages and ads+87% CTR +36% viewability rate+81% visits to landing pageAMP Landing Page relative to standard HTML Landing Page+76% conversion rate-43% cost per acquisition Simply moving from a standard HTML page to an AMP page (with the same standard HTML ad) resulted in a 26% CTR increase. Moving further to an AMP page with an AMPHTML ad resulted in an additional 48% CTR increase. The AMP page also add an extra +76% Cvr versus the standard HTML page. Conclusions Prisa’s test demonstrated that AMP’s superior performance characteristics can deliver meaningful ROI benefits to advertisers. Improved viewability and conversion rates result in lower user acquisition costs, and the benefit is multiplied when AMP pages and AMPHTML ads are deployed together. And not only does AMP provide positive ROI for publishers and advertisers, it does it while improving the end user experience, yielding a more sustainable web for everyone.

One year ago we announced our New Year’s resolution to help the open-source ecosystem become a little bit more sustainable. This is our one year funding report. For 2019 we intend to continue on our path with significantly increased investment. We believe it is increasingly clear that relying on people’s volunteered free time to drive mission critical open source software is not a sustainable mode of operation. As a community we need to find new ways to fund the valuable work on such projects. We strive to provide at least some financial support to projects that we directly depend on and that are accepting support. Total funding: $32,900 The projects we supported are ProjectsTotal contributionDescription Babel$12,600The most used transpilation system for JavaScript. Used in AMP’s development pipeline to support modern JS syntax in older browsers. Preact$12,000Super tiny React alternative. Used in AMP’s upcoming component model rework. webpack$6,000The most popular build tool for web applications and core to our amp-script strategy. document-register-element$1,200Document-register-element is the custom element we are using to drive AMP. Rollup$1,100Rollup is a super efficient bundler for JavaScript modules. We’re super glad we’ve been able to support these amazing projects and are looking forward to do even more in 2019! Posted by Malte Ubl, Member of the AMP Project Technical Steering Committee A year of open source funding Announcing AMP Conf 2019: Tokyo January 8, 2019January 8, 2019 amphtml AMP Conf 2018 in Amsterdam Last year 400 of us gathered in AMPsterdam to share the latest AMP news, and learn from the hundreds of developers engaged with the open source project. The framework has continued to evolve since our time in the Netherlands, including a new governance model and many new publishers and e-commerce websites building with AMP. In fact, we’ve seen remarkable results and growth across the Asia-Pacific region in particular. With recent examples like Indian publisher Times of India, Australian car insurance website Greenslips.co.au, and Japanese CMS EC-Cube. AMP Conf 2019 is headed to Tokyo!
