The original 20 meter track is extended to 250 meters from spring 2008, from spring 2014 to 500m and from the 2022 season to 650m.We laid 50 tons of dormitory, 2500 sleepers, and about 120 tons of stone.For the rail body there is a cable for the power supply and operation of the security equipment.Several railroad crossings were put into operation, 9 switches of which are controlled by electric motors and 15 signals.Thanks to friends and acquaintances, we have several railway caps in the collection and some parts of the uniforms that we try to use during operation.Domestic and cross -country visitors who are pleased to ride a small railway come to us, and some children do not like to leave our train very much.We carry kindergartens, public, tourists, and all possible supporters of narrow -gauge railways.All fleet is its own production.There is a set of passenger train of the Czech Railways for the 600mm passenger train, headed by a locomotive r.362 (ace), which is probably unique in the world, and the motor car Ř.810 was also completed.Currently there are three train sets with a total capacity of about 100 people.The first set consists of a four -axle locomotive with two engines, a total towing power of 24kW (electric 3kW) and two four -axle passenger cars.The second set is the already mentioned locomotive of the 362 series with two personal two -axle cars.The third train on our railway is the motor car 810, which provides the stations of the stations - Vracov Main Station, Záboří and Táboriště.There is also an automatic security device that identifies the freedom of the track using axle computers, and transports transports on the track - the so -called Autoblok.The equipped control workplace is used to ensure smooth operation.The crossing is made in a similar way and works automatically.The track runs through several land today.From all stops you can reach the pond, where there are various small sitting.The whole area can be walked on foot, even with a stroller.Do not expect anything great - after all, it's a railway in the garden.Refreshments are located in the building of the main station and also in the adjacent area with carousel and playground.We believe that this year and this year you can spend a nice Sunday afternoon, and that not only children will like the ride.We are looking forward to your visit to the operating days.Railway 600 team.: Railway 600, z.s.Strážnická 683 (not entry to the area) Entrance area: Dubová Street 696 42 Vracov IČO: 05688060 Tel.: 774 600 289 e-mail: info@zeleznice600.cz, (info@z600.cz) zdenekis@zeleznice600.cz@Zeleznice600.cz opening hours according to the deadlines.Partners: We use WordPress (in Czech).|Design: Dream created vsfish.
