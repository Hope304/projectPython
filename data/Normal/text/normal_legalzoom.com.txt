"We've used [LegalZoom] for quite a few things over the years, and overall it's gone very smoothly. They've been easy to work with and very affordable." Karen Yoo, LLC customer Bravium "Without LegalZoom, I probably would have not felt comfortable, from a time and money and effort standpoint, establishing as many brands as I did. And that would have been a bummer because those are the brands that are really keeping the lights on, and helping our business grow." Derek Rohlffs, trademark customer Nell C. "I needed to update my will. I'd heard of LegalZoom. And when I had to update some documents, I looked online at some other companies, but felt comfortable using LegalZoom. The website was very helpful. And having access to a lawyer to make sure that everything was correct made it really doable."

English | Español 100% Satisfaction Guarantee Our refund policy: We do right by you—so we'll refund our fee within the first 60 days of purchase if you're unhappy with our services. Call or email us, and we'll process your refund within 5 business days. What it doesn't cover: We can't refund third-party processing fees (e.g. paid directly to our service partners or to facilitate fulfilling your order like courier fees) once you make a purchase. And, we can't refund filing fees once we submit your paperwork to the government. Attorney fees paid directly to lawyers (and not through our legal plans) are not covered. When it applies: We can't guarantee specific legal outcomes when you use our products or services. For example, a trademark application might be filled out correctly but still get rejected by the government for reasons beyond our control. We can only refund our fee for issues we're directly responsible for. So if you purchase something and later change your mind, we can't issue a refund. For Registered Agent Services customers, you will first need to appoint a new registered agent for your business. If you need help locating the correct government form to change your registered agent with the state, please reach out to our Customer Care team.Updated: August 2, 2021 Garantía de satisfacción total Nuestra política de reembolsos: Hacemos lo correcto por usted; así que le devolveremos nuestro arancel dentro de los primeros 60 días de la compra si no está satisfecho con nuestros servicios. Llámenos o escríbanos y procesaremos su reembolso en el término de 5 días hábiles. Qué no cubre: No podemos reembolsar los costos de procesamiento de terceros (por ejemplo, los montos abonados directamente a nuestros socios de servicios o para facilitar el cumplimiento de su pedido, como los gastos de envío) una vez efectuada la compra. Tampoco podemos reembolsar los aranceles por inicio de trámite una vez que hayamos enviado su documentación al gobierno. Los honorarios legales que haya pagado directamente a un abogado (y no a través de nuestros planes legales) no están cubiertos. Cuándo se aplica: No podemos garantizar resultados legales específicos cuando usted usa nuestros productos o servicios. Por ejemplo, es posible que una solicitud de marca comercial se realice correctamente y aun así el gobierno la rechace por motivos ajenos a nosotros. Solo podemos reembolsar nuestro arancel por cuestiones de las que seamos directamente responsables. Entonces, si usted compra algo y luego cambia de parecer, no podemos concederle un reembolso. En el caso de clientes con Servicio de Agente Registrado, primero deberá designar un nuevo agente registrado para su empresa. Si necesita ayuda para encontrar el formulario de gobierno correcto y cambiar su agente registrado en el estado, comuníquese con nuestro equipo de Atención al Cliente.Fecha de actualización: 2 de agosto de 2021 LegalZoom Participating Attorneys Alabama The Law Offices of Jimmy R.
