Now scientists have come up with an easy and inexpensive way to make one- and two-dimensional versions of the same material. Read More Research with Impact: An international research team dedicated to eliminating malaria used the Advanced Photon Source to study monoclonal antibodies bound to antigen peptides. They discovered that one of the four binding modes leads to inhibitory antibody activity. Read More Research with Impact: A team of investigators explored the phase diagram of iron oxide up to the pressures it would encounter at Earth’s core-mantle boundary for the first time. Their goal was to discover whether ultralow-velocity zones beneath the surface could be enriched with iron oxide, accounting for their effect on seismic waves. Read More Research with Impact: Converting hydrocarbon gases into more valuable forms can help fight the buildup of atmospheric carbon that causes global warming. A group of scientists using the Advanced Photon Source have demonstrated a catalyst that uses a ready source of oxygen and operates at near-ambient temperatures. Read More Research with Impact: Methods aimed at identifying defects in cathodes must be able to assess their crystal structures during active charging/discharging, and in three dimensions. Researchers used the APS to track the evolution of defects in two different sodium-ion battery cathode materials. Their results showed a unique pattern of transient defects in these materials, results that could eventually help scientists engineer longer lasting and better performing cathodes. Read More Research with Impact: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are an exotic and elusive phase of matter with unusual magnetic properties that offer tantalizing prospects for quantum computing applications. A group of researchers used the APS to study a material that's considered a strong candidate for a state called a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL), but instead discovered a new state of matter that appears to be a previously unknown type of QSL. Read More Research with Impact: One way to reliably form supercrystals is by using DNA as a bonding agent between nanoparticles. Using the APS, researchers used a new approach: a combination of X-ray techniques to view defects in DNA-assembled supercrystals. Their findings revealed new insights into the growth mechanisms of these intriguing materials. Read More Research with Impact: Quashing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at its roots is a big job. The virus has many strains, and each one must be neutralized to prevent infection. A research team has now taken an iterative approach to designing boosters. Their research lays the groundwork for a vaccine regimen that may prevent HIV infection. Read More Research with Impact: The metal manganese could help to build rechargeable batteries that are more affordable and environmentally friendly than existing batteries. However, one of the major challenges is that they tend to degrade too quickly to be attractive for electric vehicles and other applications. Researchers using the APS have looked in detail at the degradation mechanism and proposed a way to counteract it. Read More Research with Impact: As our everyday lives become ever more dependent on battery technology – specifically the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) that power our smartphones, laptop computers, electric vehicles, and other portable gadgets – the quest to build ever more efficient and economical batteries has only intensified. Researchers have now demonstrated a new approach to achieving viable cobalt-free, low-nickel battery cathodes using a method called complex concentrated doping. Read More Advanced Photon Source Research with Positive Impacts on Our Health Solving the Structure of BRCA2 Protein Complex Important in DNA Repair: The initials BRCA2 may be best known for a gene associated with many cases of breast cancer, and the protein encoded by the BRCA2 gene is critical to repairing breaks in DNA. Researchers used the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source to determine the structure of a complex of two proteins that allows repairs to happen efficiently in cells undergoing cell-splitting, called meiosis. Their results have major implications for cancer and infertility.

This will increase the brightness of APS X-ray beams by up to 500 times, and new beamlines will be constructed to take advantage of these improved capabilities. The facility will be closed for operations during this time.Visit the APS Upgrade webpage for information about the project’s progress and future science at the facility. We look forward to completing the project and welcoming our users back to the APS this year. Working during the shutdown?Download the Guide to the APS Shutdown here. APS/User News APS/User News Beam back in the booster after more than nine monthsFor the first time since April 2023, electrons are circulating in the booster accelerator, bringing the Advanced Photon Source (APS) one step closer to fully returning to life. APS/User News Call for FICUS proposals open, webinar on Feb. 8The Facilities Integrating Collaborations for User Science (FICUS) program has opened its annual call for biological and environmental research proposals for fiscal year 2025. The deadline for Letter of Intent submission is March 7. APS/User News 2024 APS/CNM Users MeetingWe are bringing back the traditional Users Meeting experience this year for an exciting week of user science presentations, workshops, facility updates, and more, all taking place IN PERSON at Argonne! This year is your opportunity to network and reconnect. Register today! The registration deadline is April 22 at 4:59 p.m. CT. APS/User News Final upgraded APS storage ring modules installedThe upgrade of the Advanced Photon Source (APS), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science user facility, reached a major milestone in December 2023. The final modules of the newly upgraded electron storage ring at the heart of the APS have now been installed, a significant step toward the completion of the removal and installation phase of the project that began in April 2023.
