Software as a Service Software can be used remotely without having any specific hardware requirements Software as a Service (SaaS) approach is utilized for accessing software online via a subscription, rather than buying and installing on individual computers. SaaS is based on the “Pay As You Go” principle. Users can subscribe to attain services on a monthly or yearly basis instead of purchasing. Subscription can be ended whenever the user wants to. A location is no more a barrier. The software can be used remotely without having any specific hardware requirements.
