The best way to maintain your skin’s health and natural glow is by working with a dermatologist who specializes in cosmetic dermatology in Los Angeles.Dr. Rebecca Fitzgerald is a board-certified dermatologist who has worked with both men and women in the Los Angeles area for more than 20 years. Dr. Fitzgerald offers high-quality patient care and skilled medical insight to help patients create personalized treatment plans that suit their needs. Learn More Our Dermatology ServicesAt your first consultation, we discuss your concerns and aesthetic goals. You do not need to have a specific treatment in mind when you come to our office; we will assess your skin and make recommendations to help you make the best choices. Dr. Fitzgerald develops lasting relationships with her patients and often adapts patients’ treatment plans to their goals over time.Wrinkle RelaxersWhen you start to notice signs of aging, such as wrinkles, we can help minimize the appearance of these signs while maintaining your natural expressiveness. We have a variety of wrinkle-relaxing treatments—such as BOTOX®, DAXXIFY®, and Dysport®—all of which can help reduce the appearance of fine lines caused by facial muscle contractions. We also offer dermal fillers to fill and contour your facial structure, helping you achieve a youthful appearance.Skin RejuvenationAs you age, you may feel that your skin has lost its luster. We offer a variety of ways to help you rejuvenate your skin tone and texture. Exfoliating treatments remove superficial layers of the skin to boost collagen production and reveal a radiant complexion. We also offer targeted chemical peels as well as microneedling. Our skin rejuvenation treatments allow patients to achieve an instantly brighter complexion and feel years younger.Non-Surgical Body ContouringOur dermatology practice offers noninvasive alternatives to liposuction for getting rid of fat deposits that diet and exercise simply cannot eliminate. When you are interested in sculpting one or several areas of your body—including your chin, waist, arms, or thighs—we may recommend CoolSculpting® treatments.Clinical DermatologyWhen you are worried about redness, markings, or discolored areas of your skin, we can help. Dr. Fitzgerald can assess and diagnose skin and hair conditions such as rosacea, eczema, and acne, then prescribe the best course of treatment.
