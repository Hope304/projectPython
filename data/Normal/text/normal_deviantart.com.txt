With negative prompts, you can further control specific details in a generated image. By specifying aspects you don't want in your artwork, you have more power to shape the final outcome to coincide with your artistic vision. Do your pirates have parrots you'd prefer omitted? Did the lush, pastoral scene have more trees than you'd desire? Whether you're looking to exclude certain elements or simply lean way into exact specifications, negative prompts help fine-tune generated images to your preferences.

Did you know when they do this in a group it's called a raft? Since this month's theme is "Better Together" let’s draw a pair of snuggly sea otters! Follow along with my tutorial and post your result on DeviantArt with the tag #BetterTogetherTutorial to get this adorable badge for your profile! This tutorial is presented using digital media but can be done traditionally as well. Start off by drawing a heart! Roughly the same shape as the heart shaped candies you get around Valentine’s Day so not too narrow but also not too squat. Now inside the upper part of the heart on the left side, draw a big number 3. Do the same on the other side. You’ll have two kidney beans inside the heart. This is going to be the body of the two otters. Close off the upper part of the 3’s on both sides to represent the head of the otters.
