Your Right to Delete Personal Information: you can request that we delete your Personal Information by contacting us. You also can request that we delete specific information, and we will honor such requests, unless a due exception applies, such as when the information is necessary to complete a transaction, verify a fraud, review a chargeback or contract for which it was collected or when it is being used to detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, comply with laws, identify and repair bugs or ensure another consumer’s ability to exercise their free speech rights or other rights provided by law. Please take into consideration that we may deny your deletion request if retaining the Personal Information is necessary for us, our affiliates or our service providers in order to: Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you; Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities; Debug our products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law; Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.

International Data Transfer Notice LiteSpeed Technologies values your users’ privacy. Although our software does not directly collect any personally identifiable information from visitors to your site, LiteSpeed may still be considered a data processor in certain jurisdictions, as user information may be temporarily cached and/or logged, as outlined in this document. We have our headquarters in the State of Pennsylvania, United States of America (USA). Henceforth, your Personal Information may be accessed by us or our affiliates, agents, partners and third-party service providers in the USA and our locations which may or may not be located in your country of residence, and you hereby consent to such access and transfer by simple disclosure. Servers LiteSpeed Web Server, OpenLiteSpeed, LiteSpeed Web ADC, and related software may record IP addresses as a part of normal logging. An access log and an error log may record visitor IP addresses and URL visited. The logs are stored locally on the system where LiteSpeed server software is installed and are not transferred to or accessed by LiteSpeed employees in any way, except as necessary in providing routine technical support if you request it. This logging may be turned off through configuration. It is up to individual server administrators to come up with their own schedule for removing such logs from the file system. Cache Solutions Our cache plugins potentially store a duplicate copy of every web page on display on your site. The pages are stored locally on the system where LiteSpeed server software is installed and are not transferred to or accessed by LiteSpeed employees in any way, except as necessary in providing routine technical support if you request it. All cache files are temporary, and may easily be purged before their natural expiration, if necessary, via a Purge All command. It is up to individual site administrators to come up with their own cache expiration rules. LSCache for WordPress In addition to caching, our WordPress plugin has an Image Optimization feature. When optimization is requested, images are transmitted to a remote LiteSpeed server, processed, and then transmitted back for use on your site. LiteSpeed keeps copies of optimized images for 7 days (in case of network stability issues) and then permanently deletes them. Similarly, the WordPress plugin has a Reporting feature whereby a site owner can transmit an environment report to our server so that we may better provide technical support. Neither of these features collects any visitor data. Only server and site data is involved. Support Services Sometimes, when you request technical support, LiteSpeed may ask for login credentials to various areas of your site. You may refuse to share such credentials, however refusal may impact LiteSpeed’s ability to provide the requested support services. Upon completion of a support ticket, LiteSpeed immediately deletes all login credentials you may have shared. Any user data encountered by LiteSpeed is kept strictly confidential. We never provide your support ticket information to any third party without your explicit consent. Contact Us If you would like to update information that you have voluntarily provided to us, stop receiving information from us, or exercise any of the rights granted to you under Privacy Laws, including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, please e-mail info@litespeedtech.com.
