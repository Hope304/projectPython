The CDC says that “depending on the length of symptoms,” the length of time a person now isolates with COVID “could be shorter, the same, or longer than the previous guidance” for the disease.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The CDC’s new guidelines now resemble \u003ca href=\"#covidisolationguidelines\">California’s own updated COVID isolation recommendations\u003c/a>, which the state revised back in January. But unlike \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Isolation-Guidance.aspx#\">California’s new guidelines,\u003c/a> the latest CDC guidance does not contain any advice on what people who test positive for COVID but do \u003cem>not\u003c/em> have symptoms — known as asymptomatic infections — should do when it comes to isolation and avoiding infecting others.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once a person’s COVID symptoms are mild and improving “for at least 24 hours,” and any fever has been gone without the aid of medication for that period of time, the CDC says that they “are encouraged to take additional prevention strategies for the next 5 days to curb disease spread, such as taking more steps for cleaner air, enhancing hygiene practices, wearing a well-fitting mask, keeping a distance from others, and/or getting tested for respiratory viruses.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This 2024 update represents the first time during the pandemic that the agency has moved away from set periods of isolation for people with COVID. At the outset of the pandemic in 2020, the CDC stipulated a 10-day period of isolation for COVID-positive patients —\u003ca href=\"https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html\"> a period shortened to five days in December 2021\u003c/a>. This update was still accompanied by guidance to wear a well-fitted mask for another five days.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The CDC says that this new guidance “brings a unified approach to addressing risks from a range of common respiratory viral illnesses,” bundling guidance on COVID into that for other viruses like flu and RSV as \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/guidance/respiratory-virus-guidance.html\">one set of Respiratory Virus Guidance\u003c/a>. \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html\">The webpage that previously contained the CDC’s COVID isolation guidance\u003c/a> has now been archived, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html\">the agency’s online COVID information hub\u003c/a> contains a note stating that “The content of this page will be updated soon.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Original story from Jan. 19 continues:\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>California health officials have updated the state’s official guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11957790/the-new-covid-eris-variant-and-rising-cases-what-you-need-to-know\">how long people with COVID-19 should isolate from others\u003c/a> — with new recommendations that represent a relaxing of the isolation guidelines still in place from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Up until now, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html\">the CDC has recommended that people who test positive for COVID-19 stay home\u003c/a> and away from other people for at least five days — regardless of whether or not they have symptoms. But on Jan. 9, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Isolation-Guidance.aspx#\">the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued an update \u003c/a>that their official recommendations for Californians would now move away from the five-day rule in favor of “instead focus[ing] on clinical symptoms to determine when to end isolation.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Isolation-Guidance.aspx#\">the new guidance for COVID-positive Californians\u003c/a> says that they should still stay home until their symptoms improve and wear a mask around others indoors for 10 days.

CDPH confirmed via email to KQED that you should “still stay home if sick until symptoms are mild or improving.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once your symptoms have improved, CDPH recommends that you “Mask when you are around other people indoors for the 10 days after you become sick.” You should only remove your mask before the 10 days are up “if you have two sequential negative tests at least one day apart,” says the new CDPH guidance. If you have symptoms, Day 0 is the day those started.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>CDPH also says to “Avoid contact with people at higher risk for severe COVID-19” for those 10 days.

The first disqualification under Section 3 in more than a century came in 2022, when a New Mexico court removed Couy Griffin, who was convicted of entering the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 while leading a group called “Cowboys for Trump,” from his rural county commission.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The group that brought that case, Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, next filed the Colorado case against Trump.

Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case,” she concluded. “That is the message Americans should take home.”\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Action in the states\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>The court’s ruling shuts off using Section 3 against federal officials absent action by Congress, but it leaves open the ability of states to use the provision against their own state officials, noting there’s a rich record after the Civil War of just those sorts of actions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That’s already begun anew in the post-Jan. 6 era. The first disqualification under Section 3 in more than a century came in 2022, when a New Mexico court removed Couy Griffin, who was convicted of entering the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 while leading a group called “Cowboys for Trump,” from his rural county commission.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The group that brought that case, Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, next filed the Colorado case against Trump. They said they were eager to continue filing Section 3 cases against lower-level Jan. 6 participants.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Trump’s legal travails ahead\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>Few observers expected the Supreme Court to keep Trump off the ballot. But he’s facing a far more perilous legal road ahead.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The first of Trump’s criminal trials for allegedly falsifying business records to pay hush money to an adult film actress during the 2016 presidential campaign is scheduled to start in New York later this month. The former president is also appealing a New York judge’s ruling that he pay $355 million for fraud committed by his businesses and verdict that he pay a writer $83 million for defaming her after she sued him for sexual assault.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Depending on how and how quickly the high court rules on Trump’s immunity claim, he could still face charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election in Washington, D.C., before this November’s election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Two more cases are more likely to come later — in Atlanta, where Trump faces state charges for his 2020 election plot, and in Florida, where he’s tentatively scheduled for a May trial on improper retention of classified documents after leaving the presidency, but the trial date is expected to be postponed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Monday was a win Trump needed to continue his campaign, but his days in court are far from over.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/news/11977992/takeaways-from-trumps-supreme-court-win-he-stays-on-ballot-but-legal-peril-looms","authors":["byline_news_11977992"],"categories":["news_8"],"tags":["news_33577","news_29011","news_27626","news_20481","news_932"],"featImg":"news_11977999","label":"news"},"elections_951":{"type":"posts","id":"elections_951","meta":{"index":"posts_1591205157","site":"elections","id":"951","found":true},"guestAuthors":[],"slug":"voterguide","title":"California Voter Guide","publishDate":1702579947,"format":"standard","headTitle":"California Voter Guide | KQED","labelTerm":{"site":"elections"},"content":"\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-kqed-blocksetter\">\n\u003ch1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u003cspan>California\u003c/span> Voter Guide\u003c/h1>\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"summary-header-paragraph\">Get informed in minutes with our Voter Guide for California’s March 5 primary election.

The result is a unique, rich sauce that’s incredibly difficult to master.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_13953278\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 2000px\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-13953278\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Chicken-Mole-Empanada.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up view of the chicken mole empanada, made using Garcia's grandmother's secret recipe.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Chicken-Mole-Empanada.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Chicken-Mole-Empanada-800x533.jpg 800w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Chicken-Mole-Empanada-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Chicken-Mole-Empanada-160x107.jpg 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Chicken-Mole-Empanada-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Chicken-Mole-Empanada-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Chicken-Mole-Empanada-1920x1280.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Garcia uses his grandmother’s secret Oaxacan mole negro recipe to make his chicken mole empanada. \u003ccite>(Octavio Peña)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>What makes Garcia’s mole special is the way it gracefully balances all of the different flavors and elements.

In order to do that you need some form of subsidy.

ROC USA’s mission is to provide financing and management support to residents who are interested in forming housing cooperatives with the goal of taking mobile home parks off the private investment market.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Under this model, each resident would have a small ownership interest in the park and could only sell the park to another cooperative or non-profit. This ensures the mobile home park remains affordable and allows low-income households autonomy over decisions at the park, according to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/2485_1831_Ehlenz%20WP14ME1.pdf\">Lincoln Institute of Land Policy\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“If you belong to a limited equity housing cooperative in California, you are agreeing when you come into the deal, you get a good price for the [park] and then you pass that on to the next person by limiting the appreciation on the [park] when you sell it.” said E. Kim Coontz, Executive Director of CCCD. “We’ve got this model that’s very, very successful and it preserves affordability. Why aren’t we doing more of this in California?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Residents, however, were hesitant.

ROC USA could help the residents with a bridge loan, but only at a high interest rate, which could have raised the rents beyond what residents could pay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, yet another organization – the \u003ca href=\"https://www.law.uci.edu/academics/real-life-learning/clinics/ced.html\">UC Irvine Community & Economic Development Clinic\u003c/a> – helped park residents secure funding for the purchase through California’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.hcd.ca.gov/grants-and-funding/programs-active/manufactured-housing-opportunity-and-revitalization-program\">Manufactured Housing Opportunity & Revitalization Program\u003c/a> program and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.hcd.ca.gov/grants-and-funding/programs-active/joe-serna-jr-farmworker-housing-grant\">Farmworker Housing Grant Program\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These programs, which provided $4.5 million and $3.25 million, respectively, along with a bridge loan from ROC USA, allowed the residents to purchase the park for a little more than $7.6 million, said Adam Cowing, a law professor at the clinic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“This project would not be possible without the state funding,” Cowing said. “Part of the goal of the purchase of the park is to keep their rents affordable. In order to do that you need some form of subsidy. And that comes in the form of low interest loans from the state.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These loans offer lower interest rates and allow the park to keep rents low, according to Cowing. He estimated the residents will pay closer to $500 in rent and other fees.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cowing said that with the right amount of government funding, the limited housing co-op model is replicable, but it may not be right for every park. More legislation is needed, he said, to protect mobile home park residents and ensure they have decent housing conditions and affordable housing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“We need to make sure that residents, where they don’t necessarily set up this type of ownership structure, are still protected,” he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In all, the entire process took five years, three organizations and countless hours from residents.
