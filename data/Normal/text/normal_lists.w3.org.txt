Like microformats, RDFa allows parts of the HTML content to be used both for rendering (to the human reader) and be part of the structured (machine-readable) data. Unlike microformats, RDFa specifies only a syntax for including structured data and relies on independently-developed vocabularies (also called taxonomies or ontologies) to provide the specific terms for given data items. RDFa permits these vocabularies to be freely mixed within a single XHTML document. Additional information may be found in the RDFa Syntax specification, the RDFa Primer, and the RDFa community wiki. public-rdfjs latest subscribe unsubscribe This is the public mailing list for the RDF JavaScript Libraries Community Group.
