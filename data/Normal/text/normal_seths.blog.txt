I’ll be updating this and correcting the errors as we go.] In 2023, I developed a new idea that transforms an old way of doing commerce. In traditional auctions, there are rounds of bidding and the high bidder pays to get the prize. The last bid is the amount paid, and no one else is charged anything. This is an interesting ‘game’ in which all participants are able to express their desire for the item in monetary terms. In an efficient auction, the price paid will represent the highest utility among the bidders, with no one feeling remorse–including the seller–because the “market has spoken.” Over time, these sorts of auctions aren’t actually as efficient as they seem. This is why other times of auctions have evolved. These include: The three other common types of auctions are (via Wikipedia): Dutch Auction: In a Dutch auction, the auctioneer starts with a high asking price, which is gradually lowered until a bidder accepts the price, winning the item. Multiple units of the same item can be sold simultaneously, with the price decreasing until all units are sold or until a bidder accepts the current price. Sealed-Bid Auction: In this type of auction, bidders submit their bids privately without knowing the bids of others. Once all bids are received, they are opened simultaneously, and the highest bidder wins the item. This format encourages bidders to submit their true valuation of the item. Vickrey Auction: Also known as a second-price sealed-bid auction, this format is similar to a sealed-bid auction, but the winner pays the second-highest bid rather than their own bid. This encourages bidders to bid their true valuation, as they won’t pay more than what they believe the item is worth. When bidders have an understanding of the nature of the bidders in the room as well as their options, bidding is skewed. For things like spectrum, this can cost the seller billions of dollars. I chose to address the problem of charity auctions. Often run at galas, they depend on a combination of status and alcohol to generate high bids for items that the buyers might not have imagined wanting to purchase before the event began. As a result, the results are often quite disappointing to the seller, often a worthy cause. The positive auction transforms the dynamics of a charity auction by changing two elements: Most profoundly, every bid is a donation. Bidding begins at $10 and increments by ten dollars per bid. Bidders are not permitted to skip a step. The total raised increases exponentially. Specifically S=(n/2)​(2a+(n−1)d) S is the final sum. a is the first number and d is the increment. In practice, then, the bidding results look like this: Starting bid$5Incremental bid$10Number of bids125Winning bid$1,245﻿﻿Total raised$78,125﻿﻿﻿﻿Starting bid$5Incremental bid$10Number of bids150Winning bid$1,495﻿﻿Total raised$112,500 The organizer of the auction can offer free bids to bidders at no cost to the seller. In fact, free bids can actually increase the amount raised. The second innovation is incorporating “free bids” into the auction. For example, a free bid could be rewarded to anyone who recruits someone who bids in an auction. When used, the free bid ratchets up the auction, meaning that the next bid will be higher. Even if a free bidder wins the auction, they haven’t decreased the amount of money raised. In practice, a positive auction creates an unstable equilibrium. If we consider an auction with 150 bids, the winner pays only $1,495 but gets an item that might be worth $100,000. It’s difficult to look away from this gap without exploring it. We’re taking the dynamics of positive auctions and building GOODBIDS around it, providing a tool for worthy causes to raise money. Positive auctions paper (via Claude.ai):Abstract:This paper introduces a novel auction format, the positive auction, designed to address the inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes often associated with traditional charity auctions. By incorporating two key innovations—treating every bid as a donation and introducing free bids—the positive auction model aims to increase total funds raised for charitable causes while maintaining an engaging and competitive bidding environment.1. IntroductionCharity auctions play a vital role in generating funds for worthy causes. However, traditional auction formats often fail to maximize the potential for fundraising, as they rely heavily on factors such as status and impulsive bidding behavior. This paper presents the positive auction model, a transformative approach to charity auctions that seeks to address these shortcomings and optimize the fundraising process.2. The Positive Auction Model2.1 Every Bid as a DonationThe core principle of the positive auction is that every bid placed by a participant constitutes a donation to the charitable cause. Bidding commences at a fixed starting price and increases by a predetermined increment with each subsequent bid. Participants are required to follow the incremental bidding sequence, ensuring a structured and transparent process.The total funds raised through a positive auction can be calculated using the following formula:_S_\=(n/2)​(2_a_+(_n_−1)_d_)Where:_S_ = total sum raised_n_ = number of bids_a_ = starting bid amount_d_ = bid incrementThis formula demonstrates the exponential growth potential of the positive auction model, with total funds raised increasing significantly as the number of bids grows.2.2 Free BidsThe positive auction introduces the concept of “free bids” to further enhance the fundraising potential. Free bids are awarded to participants based on predefined criteria, such as recruiting additional bidders to the auction. These free bids serve to increase the overall number of bids placed, driving up the total funds raised without any additional cost to the charitable organization.3. Unstable Equilibrium and IncentivesThe positive auction creates an unstable equilibrium, where the winning bidder may secure an item of substantial value for a relatively low final bid price. This disparity between the item’s perceived value and the winning bid price serves as a powerful incentive for participants to continue bidding, as the potential for securing a high-value item at a bargain price is a compelling prospect.4. Practical Application: GOODBIDSThe positive auction model has been implemented through the development of GOODBIDS, a platform designed to facilitate fundraising for charitable causes. By providing a user-friendly interface and automating the bidding process, GOODBIDS aims to make the positive auction model accessible to a wide range of organizations and individuals seeking to maximize their fundraising efforts.5. ConclusionThe positive auction model represents a significant advancement in the field of charity auctions, offering a novel approach to maximizing fundraising potential while maintaining an engaging and competitive bidding environment. By treating every bid as a donation and introducing the concept of free bids, the positive auction creates an unstable equilibrium that incentivizes participants to continue bidding, ultimately leading to increased funds raised for worthy causes. The development of platforms like GOODBIDS further enhances the practical application of this innovative auction format, promising to revolutionize the landscape of charitable fundraising. March 5, 2024 On building a cathedral If you’re in need of a gathering place, a dry, functional, centrally located facility for your folks to meet, a cathedral is probably way more than you need. It’s far more expensive to build and maintain and not optimal in delivering what’s required. But what if this building needs to fill other functions as well? Perhaps it’s a message to your membership about longevity, status and commitment. Perhaps it’s a signal to the local government that you have real resources and are not to be trifled with. And perhaps it is a beacon designed to attract people who haven’t yet heard about your work. Or maybe it’s something we do simply because we can. In our rush for serviceable, we race to the bottom. The thing we’re working on is a rare chance to contribute something far more than the least we could get away with. You can’t build a cathedral every day, and you can’t do it for cheap. But sometimes we get the chance to create something that really matters. Headwinds When it’s tough going and it feels fraught, it’s easy to imagine that the headwinds will never end. And yet, when all is going well and the wind is at our back, it’s tempting to imagine that this is the way it’s going to stay. Neither is true. The reason we see them as headwinds is that they shift. March 4, 2024 Becoming intentional about virtual meetings A manual I recently read listed the “cons” of having a meeting virtually: Limits options for engagement Engagement can be less meaningful At home distractions More difficult to read body language and ensure participants are engaged Technical difficulties can impact the quality of the training To be accurate, every one of these points should have “so far” added. The videogame market is far bigger than the box office of Hollywood films. The people who play video games at home for hours at a time have no problem with engagement, with meaning, with distractions or with body language. That’s because a well-designed videogame solves for all these problems. If, even once, you’ve had a virtual meeting that engaged you and made you feel connected to someone else, then it’s clearly possible. The hard work is deciding to put in the effort to have it happen more often. Lazy simulations of in-person meetings are not a worthy substitute. March 3, 2024 The weird math of halfway 6 times 1/2 doesn’t equal 3. It equals zero. We’re tempted to do a little less than we need to. Perhaps we’re busy, with too many options. Perhaps it’s resistance, pushing us to hold a little bit back. Whatever the reason, when we show up just a little, we get zero credit. The smallest viable audience plus focus and care is additive. Less than 1 is still zero. March 2, 2024 The question book In the old days, companies had a suggestion box. It was immortalized in cartoons, but the idea that an employee could anonymously submit a suggestion to make things better is a first step in engagement. Some companies took this much further and paid employees for suggestions that generated profits. Digital communication and more open workplaces have made the necessity for a box like this decrease. But we’re still often hung up on the odd cultural stigma around seeming dumb. So people don’t raise their hands, don’t ask questions and work in frustration and ignorance instead. Something we learn as teenagers. Perhaps we can begin with a teenager-focused solution. When your kid turns 12, give them a blank notebook. “Any time you have a question that’s embarrassing or you’re not sure who to ask, just write it down in this notebook and put it on my bed. I’ll write out an answer and return it the next day.” By taking off some of the interpersonal pressure, this creates a useful channel for questions and answers. And what happens if we bring the same medium to work? March 1, 2024 The leap In action movies, there’s a lot of leaping. Brave shifts in which the hero gets from here to there, all at once. It’s easy to imagine that sudden leaps are how we make our impact. This is blog post #9000 (give or take). When did the leap happen? It wasn’t an external leap. The first hundred blog posts were read by fewer than a dozen people. It was an internal one. The decision to be a blogger. And then redeciding, each day, not to stop. Every four years, we have a worldwide holiday to celebrate this sort of leap. The leap of choice. Not to suddenly get from here to there, but to choose to go on the journey. It’s only once every 1,460 days, you can do it. Leap today. Perhaps we begin by visualizing it. In the most concrete terms you can find, write it down. If you took a leap today, what would it look like? Who would benefit? And then, share it with just one other person. Often, the act of physically writing it down is the most difficult part. February 29, 2024 By association We’re busy, we’re confused and we’re always seeking a shortcut. If a company is hiring, the person who worked at Google or Apple or Disney gets more of the benefit of the doubt. Even if all they did was bring coffee to someone. But, if that person was one of the hundreds laid off yesterday as a result of Apple shuttering their car project, not so much. If you get pitched by someone who worked at Bird or Theranos or General Magic, what pile do they go in? What about someone who was the assistant to an actor who just got nominated for an Academy Award vs. someone who worked for a has-been? It’s not hard to extend this to people who went to a school with a successful football team, or who are part of a group that traditionally is given an advantage due to an accident of birth. These are false proxies. But it’s such a natural instinct that we have to work to intentionally overcome it. Luck isn’t contagious.

Thank you. February 27, 2024 What are the stakes? How big a swing do we need to make it feel like it matters? At the casino, some folks play with $5 chips, some with $100 chips. Do the high rollers have more fun? Are they more engaged? It’s natural to imagine that bigger swings matter more. That a bigger audience means our standup needs to be better, or a bigger investment is a signal that our business matters more. More and better aren’t the same. There are very few projects that have an impact on every human. Most are more local than that. Winning the regional Math Olympiad can feel just as important as winning the Super Bowl, and entire countries will be unaware of both events. If you need it to feel like life or death for the work to matter, the problem might not be that you don’t get enough near-death opportunities. It might be that you’ve signed up to work in crisis mode. Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies. By continuing to use this website, you agree to their use.
