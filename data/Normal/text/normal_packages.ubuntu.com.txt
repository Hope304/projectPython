Removed the obsolete powerpc data for hardy. I'm currently evaluation if and how I should include information about ports.ubuntu.com packages here. Since archive.ubuntu.com is currently unusable I use nl.archive.ubuntu.com as source for the data until the situation normalizes again. 2008-02-21 The downtime today was caused by some yet undiagnosed kernel troubles after a faulty hard disk was exchanged. Sorry for any inconvenience. 2008-02-19 Switched packages.ubuntu.com to the newer codebase that also runs on packages.debian.org. The two most important changes for users are that most pages are now generated dynamically (which makes for faster updates and more flexibility) and that the search functions should be much faster now. Still waiting for a volunteer that optimizes the used stylesheets, I myself have not much talent in this area... 2007-10-21 Add hardy. 2007-10-18 Change default release to gutsy. 2007-07-28 Drop old releases since they also got dropped from archive.ubuntu.com. 2007-04-29 Feisty is released. Pages updated accordingly. 2006-11-20 The hard drive of the server was replaced today after it began to act up. Most stuff should be up and running again. I accidentally deleted the info about new packages though, so that will be not reliable for the next few days. Added edgy-backports to the homepage and the search forms 2006-10-29 Add feisty. The changes for the edgy release were already done some days ago. 2006-10-18 The "Bug reports" links now correctly point to Launchpad for all packages. Thanks to all the people that reported this error to me. I added an robots.txt to ban some people trying to mirror the site by means of wget -r. If forever reason you need to mirror the site please contact me by mail so we can do this by other means that won't stress the server as much. 2006-06-12 Finally make dapper the default for searches and add edgy. Sorry for the delay. 2006-01-17 I hope everyone had a good start into the new year. Some small status updates: While looking at the log statistics I noticed that apparently packages.ubuntulinux.org also points to my server without me knowing. I fixed the apache configuration so that it now knows about that and handles it correctly. Linking to a CSS file on the official Ubuntu homepage was a bad idea and the page had some glitches when it disappeared. Most of the issues should be fixed by now. Sorry for any performance issues with the site. My little server is not always able to handle the many hits of this site (close to 2,000,000 per month). I guess I will have to search for another hosting solution in the near future. 2005-10-13 Changed all defaults to point to breezy 2005-09-28 The contents files are updated again, so I removed any warnings and added the appropriate links back The "Check for bug reports" links now point to Launchpad for universe/multiverse packages. Suggested by j -at- bootlab -dot- org. Finally, I migrated to the "new" layout. Comments and Patches about the remaining quirks welcome. 2005-09-25 I've merged the new changelog to HTML conversion code from the Debian branch. I still have no idea how to handle the requests to link Ubuntu bugs to the Ubuntu BTS and Debian bugs to the Debian BTS. Suggestions welcome. 2005-08-30 I've added a warning to this site about the outdated Contents files in the Ubuntu archive which make the contents search completely useless for anything after warty. I've actually no idea whom to ask about this since I don't seem to be able to find out on the Ubuntu web site who is ftp-master in Ubuntu? You can now also browse the packages from hoary-backports 2005-06-10 I have begun to work on integrating the current Ubuntu web design with my pages. There are still some issues to work out but as a teaser I already converted the front page. Feel free to mail me with comments on how I could use the new layout better. 2005-04-14 hoary is released and now this fact is also beginning to show on this page. Please report all errors you find with the new breezy pages. 2005-04-06 The transition should be completed by now and I've installed some rewrite rules so that old URLs should also point to the new location. The changelog extraction script is still running so there are still some (more) broken links. Please report all other problems you might encounter. 2005-04-05 From tomorrow on this site will be available at packages.ubuntu.com. The necessary setup is done on both my side and on the side of the ubuntu people but I will use the occasion for some configuration clean-up and a full rebuild. Stay tuned ;) 2005-04-02 On request of the MOTUs I've added links to the build logs for hoary packages. Also, the Portuguese LoCoTeam (hmm, Ubuntu teams have all very l33t names ;) asked me how to translate the pages. Here my answer: At http://cvs.infodrom.org/packages.debian.org/po/?cvsroot=debian.de you can find some .pot files. Please translate them and send them back to me (You may want to take a look at the translations available at http://cvs.debian.org/webwml/portuguese/po/?cvsroot=webwml especially for files like langs.pot). This will ensure that at least the constant strings on all the pages are translated (Some of the strings in these file are only needed on packages.debian.org) The translations of package descriptions I took from the DDTP (Debian Descriptions Translation Project) which seems to be rather inactive lately. Unless this is fully revived or another similar project is created there is little I can do on this front. Thanks to all people that provided me with positive feedback about these pages. 2005-03-02 I talked briefly with Daniel Silverstone of Canonical at FOSDEM. He said that Ubuntu will get his own Packages page, but It will be a while. 2005-01-24 In the last two days there were several reboots of the server needed (kernel upgrades, activation and testing of a new rescue system). Sorry for any inconviences this caused. 2005-01-11 There are changelogs and copyright files available now. I also added links to the Ubuntu bugzilla, but I'm not sure yet that they work completly. Feedback welcome. (Changelogs and copyright files may be missing for some packages since I can only mirror the i386 and powerpc debs due to space constraints) This page is also available in the following languages: Български (Bəlgarski) Deutsch suomi français magyar 日本語 (Nihongo) Nederlands polski Русский (Russkij) slovensky svenska Türkçe українська (ukrajins'ka) 中文 (Zhongwen,简) 中文 (Zhongwen,繁) Content Copyright © 1997 - 2013 Canonical Ltd.; See license terms.
