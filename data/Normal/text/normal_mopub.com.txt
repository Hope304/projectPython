Here’s what our developers are saying “ Implementing MAX not only increased our product revenue, but it saved us a lot of operational costs, which allowed our team to refocus their energy on creating great games. Yudai Hatasa Producer, KAYAC “ We are already seeing incredible lift and increases in revenue across our top titles, which allows us to invest more in user acquisition. Dmitry Shelengovskiy CEO, Playgendary “ AppLovin made it easy to migrate to MAX and we saw immediate improvements by switching, including a 30% ARPDAU lift on iOS. We were surprised to achieve this much of an improvement without additional optimizations. And even after, the AppLovin team continued to help us with additional tools, integrations, and testing, which drove our total revenue even higher.
