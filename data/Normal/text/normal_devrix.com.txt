Start Now This Is the Reason Why We Are Doing Our Job in the Best Possible Way Looking for a committed WordPress agency providing long-term peace of mind? Jon Reed Co-Founder, diginomica.com DevriX has been able to add sophisticated functionality to diginomica.com while maintaining a very high mobile-first design standard. That’s a tough balance to maintain. One remarkable thing: I have never met the DevriX team. We have never even spoken on the phone or VoIP. Another member of our team has spoken with them, but the point is I’ve been able to get projects done with DevriX that involved complex design requirements without ever talking real-time. That requires an exceptional attention to detail. I cannot recommend DevriX highly enough. Adam Sewall VP Marketing, Verkada DevriX enabled us to deliver an entirely reimagined B2B website in under 3 weeks. From backend integrations to mobile layouts on the frontend, I was continually impressed with the team’s knowledge and, equally important, ability to think like a user. The engineers weren’t just completing deliverables — they were proactively suggesting solutions to our challenges, and filling in gaps where requirements were incomplete or unclear. Communication was clear and effective throughout the course of the project. Highly recommended for teams looking to move fast! Katie Bottrell Spotlio Working with DevriX and retaining their full-service WordPress solutions has been an absolute pleasure. Their team is consistently responsive and capable, guiding us seamlessly from the initial stages of defining scope to the execution and ongoing management of our website. I particularly value their organized project plans and excellent communication via project management tools. Moreover, their commitment to scheduling regular meetings within my time zone shows their dedication to their client relationships. DevriX is always eager to address any questions or concerns, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks, and they’re nimble when it comes to reprioritizing tasks or adapting to changes in direction. Kris Gunnars Founder, AuthorityNutrition Before I started working with DevriX, I was having severe stability problems with my high-traffic website that gets over 10 million visits per month. They helped me migrate the site to a new webhost and fixed some code issues. Since then I’ve had a near 100% uptime, with an even faster site than before. The team at DevriX is highly knowledgeable about WordPress coding best practices and they always focused on clean code and fast loading times. I highly recommend working with them if you have a WordPress website. Tom Murray Viral Lead Machine Mario, Stanko and team are great to work with. We’ve worked with them on a number of complex, original applications, and can always count on them to bring extensive knowledge and skill to every project. They’re also very conscientious in their approach – always striving to build the most technically reliable solution. If you’re looking to create a robust software exactly to spec, then I’d highly recommend these guys! Julius Solaris Director, SocialCoup LTD Working with Mario and his team has been a great pleasure. It is difficult to find reliable developers that actually understands WordPress Architecture while managing client communication professionally, Mario is one of the few of them. Definitely recommend. All Hip Hop Greg Watkins, founder of AllHipHop.com, shares valuable insights about his work experience with DevriX. We established a strong working relationship with the company in 2020, which lead to us building their new arbitrage-based platform, creating a custom header-bidding stack to monetize paid traffic.

In November of 2018, they were doing significant traffic (30MM+ page views per month) and hitting a wall with scaling challenges. With these performance issues limiting their growth it was imperative that we get them through the wall and remove the scaling barrier that was capping their growth and damaging their brand.
