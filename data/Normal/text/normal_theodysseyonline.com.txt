That will keep you from looking backMelody Tamminen01 MarchWashington State University 36200 Melody Tamminen I am one of those people who enjoys to “live in the moment.” I don’t put much thought into the future because it could change at the drop of a hat, and I don’t like to think about the past because what’s done is done.
