You’ve likely seen it in use all over the web. The original version of Infinite Scroll was first released by Paul Irish 2008. It was a break-through work of front-end development, granting web developers a cutting edge experience via a user-friendly yet powerful jQuery plugin. That lineage scrolls on to this day.

Getting started Include the Infinite Scroll .js file in your site. <script src="/path/to/infinite-scroll.pkgd.min.js"></script> Infinite Scroll works on a container element with item elements. <div class="container"> <article class="post">...</article> <article class="post">...</article> <article class="post">...</article> ... </div> There are several ways to initialize Infinite Scroll. Initialize with jQuery You can use Infinite Scroll as a jQuery plugin: $('selector').infiniteScroll(). $('.container').infiniteScroll({ // options path: '.pagination__next', append: '.post', history: false, }); Initialize with vanilla JavaScript You can use Infinite Scroll with vanilla JS: new InfiniteScroll( elem ). The InfiniteScroll() constructor accepts two arguments: the container element and an options object. let elem = document.querySelector('.container'); let infScroll = new InfiniteScroll( elem, { // options path: '.pagination__next', append: '.post', history: false, }); // element argument can be a selector string // for an individual element let infScroll = new InfiniteScroll( '.container', { // options }); Initialize with HTML You can initialize Infinite Scroll in HTML, without writing any JavaScript. Add data-infinite-scroll attribute to the carousel element. Options can be set in its value. <div class="container" data-infinite-scroll='{ "path": ".pagination__next", "append": ".post", "history": false }'> Options set in HTML must be valid JSON. Keys need to be quoted, for example "path":. Note that the attribute value uses single quotes ', but the JSON entities use double-quotes ". Next Options API Features Back-button friendly Infinite Scroll upholds URLs by changing them automatically as the user scrolls. Users can refresh the current page or return to a scrolled page and their position will be maintained. No more tears when you scroll 20 pages and accidentally hit refresh. Try out the full page demo. Easy start, powerful build Infinite Scroll works out-of-the-box with any blog or WordPress site. With its robust array of options, methods, and events, you can add custom behaviors, notifications, and loading animations to fully integrate Infinite Scroll into your user experience.
