Our membership of the Consortium helps ensure the sustainability of this critical software on their behalf - in essence we contribute £37.60 per instance per year for a fully supported and actively developed security product, which we believe is extremely good value for money." Dr Rhys Smith, Chief Technical Architect, Trust and Identity at Jisc Reliable and sustainable software developed by a team of competent professionals is key to DFN. DFN-AAI has become one of our most important services and we owe a large part of this to the Shibboleth community. Our membership is a tribute as well as a commitment to the success of Shibboleth. Christian Grimm, DFN CEO We have chosen Shibboleth as basis for our federation many years ago - and it has turned out to be an excellent choice! Christoph Witzig We value the competence and the timely and professional responses to our queries. Especially the messenger channel for technical support provides ideal access to all Shibboleth developers. Without our membership we couldn‘t provide so reliable Shibboleth related services for our customers.
