Charting a course for the future of psychedelics Since 1986 History Since 1986, MAPS has worked tirelessly to build and share the blueprint for ending psychedelic prohibition. This MAPS blueprint is being used throughout the world to take an evidence-based approach to psychedelic healing. As a nonprofit, MAPS has relied on the support of people like you to pursue our mission, build a movement, and change the way people think about, talk about, and consume psychedelics through research, education, and advocacy. Values Working to end psychedelic prohibition requires transparency and perseverance. Our work relies on the support of people from all backgrounds with all types of experience and contributions to share. Our approach is informed by our Seven Principles. We strive to embody an unwavering commitment to equity and compassion. Moreover, we are committed to a culture of curiosity and a long-term vision informed by research. Impact MAPS has incubated what will likely be the first psychedelic-assisted therapy to obtain government approval in the US. Thanks to our community of supporters and dedicated team, we have been able to spread this playbook widely, develop groundbreaking psychedelic education, and host the largest gathering of the Psychedelic Renaissance. Ultimately, we aim to end drug prohibition everywhere and unlock the healing potential of psychedelics for all who seek their benefit. Vision We envision a world where psychedelics and marijuana are safely and legally available for beneficial uses—where research is governed by rigorous scientific evaluation of their risks and benefits. Our priority is public benefit, and our approach reflects this commitment to community over profit. Our work is intended to support the rights and dignity of all those who use these drugs free from fear and stigma.
