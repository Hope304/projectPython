Until WP quits being an antiquated, monetized pit of code, this is all that’s holding my sanity in check. Ross J Kuhn Bedrock is doing a huge service to the WordPress community, and I can see it being adopted as the standard for WordPress development. Hopefully as more people adopt it, the developer community at large will view WordPress sites on similar footing as more “professional” platforms. Daniel Strunk If you have to use WordPress, use Bedrock for your web app and Sage to develop your custom theme. Any Laravel developer will feel at home in these tools. Rory McDaniel I think 2 years ago I tweeted to y'all to say I love Sage -- now I'm getting started with Bedrock and loving it! thank you for making me feel like WordPress can be sane, secure, and modern.
