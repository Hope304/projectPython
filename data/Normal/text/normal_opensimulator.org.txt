It can be used to create a virtual environment (or world) which can be accessed through a variety of clients, on multiple protocols, see Connecting. Optional Hypergrid allow users to visit other OpenSimulator installations across the web from their 'home' installation or grid. In this way, it is the basis of a nascent distributed Metaverse. OpenSimulator allows virtual world developers to customize their worlds using the technologies they feel work best - we've designed the framework to be easily extensible. OpenSimulator is written in C#, running both on Windows over the .NET Framework and on Unix-like machines over the Mono framework. The source code is released under a BSD License, a commercially friendly license to embed OpenSimulator in products. If you want to know about our development history, see History. OpenSimulator can be used to simulate virtual environments similar to Second Life™. However, OpenSimulator does not aim to become a clone of the Second Life server platform. Rather, the project aims to enable innovative feature development for virtual environments and the Metaverse at large. OpenSimulator is getting more stable over time but is still a high complex software system that can suffer various bugs and quirks; handle with care! Features Supports online, multi-user 3D environments as small as 1 simulator or as large as thousands of simulators. Supports 3D virtual spaces of variable size. Supports multiple clients and protocols - access the same world at the same time via multiple protocols. Supports realtime, simulator side, Physics Simulation. Supports clients that create 3D content in real time. Supports inworld scripting using LSL/OSSL. Provides unlimited ability to customize virtual world applications through the use of scene modules.
