Annual ReportRead our highlights from the past year. Click here to download the report Previous Next The Minnesota Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center is dedicated to fighting the spread and impact of aquatic invasive species on Minnesota’s beloved lakes and rivers.Aquatic invasive species (AIS) began arriving in Minnesota in the 1800s, but the current rate of invasion is increasing. Although aquatic invasive species may seem unstoppable, there is hope. With a solid foundation of research below our feet and exciting new projects underway, MAISRC is well-positioned to build on past success and inform real-world solutions in the coming years. Thanks to MAISRC’s research, we can find invasive species earlier, we can better respond to new infestations, and we have developed new tools to control established populations. For example, informed by MAISRC research, for the first time, eradication is an achievable goal for an AIS in Minnesota and managers are implementing a large, coordinated effort against non-native Phragmites. Who We AreCreated in 2012 through funds from the Minnesota legislature, our Center has grown into a respected partner and national leader in the fight against aquatic invasive species. MAISRC is a multidisciplinary team that plays a central role for AIS research in Minnesota. MissionMAISRC's mission is to develop research-based solutions that can reduce the impacts of aquatic invasive species in Minnesota by preventing spread, controlling populations, and managing ecosystems; and to advance knowledge to inspire action by others. You can learn more about our plans for the future in our 2015 - 2025 Strategic Plan. Recent NewsA Letter from the DirectorMinnesota Sea Grant Co-Hosts Great Lakes Fish Farm SessionBeltrami Co. Residents Learn How to Identify AIS at ‘Starry Trek’ TrainingWhite Bear’s largest water body makes A grade for quality Explore our recent work in the fieldMeeting our mission to develop research-based solutions to reduce the impacts of aquatic invasive species means that our teams conduct research throughout the entire state. Whether it’s studying impacts, gathering samples, trialing new management approaches, or collaborating with partners to find solutions to AIS problems, if there’s a waterbody threatened by AIS in Minnesota, there’s a good chance one of our teams has been there.
