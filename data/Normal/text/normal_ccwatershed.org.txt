On the contrary: the Pope’s ministry is a guarantee of obedience to Christ and to his Word. He must not proclaim his own ideas, but rather constantly bind himself and the Church to obedience to God’s Word, in the face of every attempt to adapt it or water it down, and every form of opportunism.” — ‘His Holiness, Pope Benedict XVI (11 May 2005)’ Recent Posts PDF Downloads • “Contemporary Sacred Music” “The Christian Can Only Be an Optimist!” “The Most Captivating Chorale” • (J.
