Neil Kyungmi Shin with Andrew Woolbright Christopher Rothko with Phong H. Bui James Welling with Robert Slifkin Sherman Sam with Barry Schwabsky Art In Conversation Sherman Sam with Barry Schwabsky Longtime readers of the Brooklyn Rail will remember the insightful critical contributions Sherman Sam regularly made from London—and occasionally from elsewhere: Dublin, Porto, his native Singapore—between 2006 and 2011. But they may not know his remarkable paintings, which have been seen in the US only a handful of times. Art In Conversation Paul Pfeiffer with Jonathan T.D. Neil Anyone familiar with Paul Pfeiffer’s pioneering moving-image work knows that he has been out ahead of “the culture” for more than twenty years. Yet the manipulations and labors he thought to exert on at-one-time recalcitrant film and video frames have now been incorporated into platform and persuasion technologies that have touched us all, whether we’re aware of it or not. Art In Conversation Christopher Rothko with Phong H. Bui As I think of the successes and failures of artists’ legacies, I’ve learned different stories tell different life’s circumstances, depending on luck and persistent efforts on the behalf of those who are dedicating their lives to perpetually keeping the artists’ works alive and contextually relevant in the former, while in the latter what requires of the artists’ caretakers, be it members of their families, friends or colleagues there my lack of clarity of intentions or self-motivations. Art In Conversation Kyungmi Shin with Andrew Woolbright Kyungmi Shin’s Monsters, Vases and The Priest at Sperone Westwater is an act of ceremony. Moving between timelines, the artist has collapsed the space of images through painting to form an important site for contemplation; for gathering distant experiences and ushering them into the present. In understanding her family lineage she avoids self-mythologizing and instead, more broadly, examines the beauty and dignity of the Asian experience. Art In Conversation James Welling with Robert Slifkin When James Welling gets deeply involved in a project, he sees the subjects he’s interested in everywhere. His current body of work, Thought Objects, emphasizes textured surfaces. Some of his subjects include flowers, Brutalist architecture, a blue door in Paris, a sculpture table in Guilford, but his photographs do much more than convey subject matter, they open out into fields of metaphor and analogy. From the Publisher & Artistic Director Dear Friends and Readers By Phong Bui Though the advent of social media has created a brilliant democratic openness, those same social media also carry a lot of destructive tendencies. Many of us remember that we once received thoughtful letters from people who agreed or disagreed with what we may have voiced in an essay, an exhibition, or a lecture; and we knew that those complimentary or dissenting responses each required a certain amount of time to compose. Editor's Message Captives of Heartbr(ache) By Ksenia Soboleva I’m writing the introduction to this month’s Critics Page as the year 2023 is coming to an end, a year in which I’ve spent much time with the idea of queer heartbr(ache). It began when my friend and cosmic mirror (our birthdays are exactly six months apart) Le’Andra LeSeur and I had our first significant heart to heart about recent breakups that had left us tender.
