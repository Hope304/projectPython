From Our Community Explore Over 50,000 Reviews & 6,500 Alumni Interviews Meet Jennifer AIFS Abroad in Barcelona, Spain "Im happy I was able to see Morocco with AIFS because I don't know how I would've travelled there on my own. AIFS offers so many scholarships and made it possible despite of the roadblocks. I was able to win a scholarship of over $6,500. I was a first generation student so studying abroad was really getting me out of my comfort zone." View Program Meet Hannah Volunteer Abroad in Costa Rica "This was quite simply the most rewarding, exciting and fun 3 months of my life! I had the opportunity to work on three different projects from a trek across the country building the confidence of international youth, to digging trails in a National Park to bring tourism to a new remote area, to building a school in an indigenous community." View Program Meet Olivia Seoul Internships with Beyond Academy "Coming to Seoul through this program was one of the best things I’ve done! The program also provided so much support so even for those who aren’t comfortable going out on their own you still get so many chances to do anything and everything. I’ve made so many new friends through this experience and it has completely transformed the way I travel."
