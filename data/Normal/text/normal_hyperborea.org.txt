(In theory itâ€™s a shared family blog, but Iâ€™m the main one who posts there these days.) Tech Tips, Troubleshooting and How-Tos, a collection of computer problems I've run into and how I solved them (or how I found the solutions). Reviews of books, movies, software, etc. Creativity Short stories and poetry Scenic photos from the 1990s. I also ran a photo blog at WordPress for a few years, and I have tons more photos on Flickr. The Music Hall - MIDI files I put together from madrigals so I could use them for choir practice Fandom Re-Reading Les MisÃ©rables - A blog in which I comment on the novel and review various adaptations. Flash: Those Who Ride the Lightning - Fan reference site for DC Comicsâ€™ speedsters, their enemies, and supporting cast up through 2011, when I ran out of free time to maintain it. (The Speed Force blog spun out of it, and is still going.) Fan Convention Reports & Photos Humor Humor Files Funny quotes and other random amusements collected from 1998-2005. Googolplex Theaters - a 2005 April Foolâ€™s joke that seems more plausible now than it did at the time. My Gemini Capsule contains a subset of this website in Gemini, an ultra-light protocol and format thatâ€™s somewhere between Gopher and a minimalist Web. For surfing the "smol internet" I recommend Lagrange on Windows, macOS and Linux, Amfora for terminal access, Seren on Android, and Elaho on iOS. I have a bunch of articles from my Web Advocacy days.
