The IPTC is the global standards body of the news media. We provide the technical foundation for the news ecosystem. Our Standards For Developers + Photo Metadata + Video Metadata Hub + Media Topics + RightsML + NewsML-G2 I've had a chance to be hands on with the development of a video standard, and I have learned about new tech and solutions which have become quite useful in our day to day at the office. Mark Milstein, Microstocksolutions Our consulting work benefits from the mature standards of IPTC to build customised solutions for our clients. Robert Schmidt-Nia, DATAGROUP Participating in the weekly meetings gives me a chance to learn how other members actually use IPTC standards in their applications. Guowei Wu, 新华社 (Xinhua News Agency) My participation has led to information sharing with companies such as the CBC and the Associated Press, and speaking engagements around the world. Jennifer Parrucci, The New York Times Company Being a member of the IPTC is perfect for any company that needs to protect the copyrights of creators but at the same time, contribute to a more accessible web. Alison Sullivan, Individual Member Using the IPTC Metadata schemas is a win-win for anyone working in a large enterprise environment that needs to share images or a video library for advertising. Alison Sullivan, Individual Member The IPTC metadata standards close the loop between creation and distribution by providing a clear path to communicate critical copyright management information and accessibility text seamlessly across multiple publishing systems. Alison Sullivan, Individual Member Standardized metadata is required for accurate search and true interoperability. It’s a huge benefit to actually have input into standards which are used worldwide. Linda Burman, Individual Member Learning about the challenges colleagues face when trying to integrate IPTC standards into their existing company workflows benefits my consulting practice Linda Burman, Individual Member One of the things I’ve really enjoyed about the IPTC is the chance to get to know fellow members at Face-to-Face meetings. When you have that connection, it transfers to online meetings. Linda Burman, Individual Member Being a member of the IPTC makes it easy to learn from other professionals in similar businesses who are adopting and implementing photo metadata standards. Karl Csoknyay, Keystone SDA As a member of the IPTC I can also contribute to the actual standards development which is a big benefit to my company. Karl Csoknyay, Keystone SDA It’s great to be a part of the IPTC Photo Metadata team to help photo businesses learn how to use the metadata standard for their benefit. Michael Steidl, Honorary Member IPTC photo metadata provides descriptions plus rights and administrative information of an image in ways that can’t be said by just pixels. Michael Steidl, Honorary Member Metadata is the foundation of search and discovery, and video metadata allows moving image collections to act as a first class citizen of data science and systems. Pam Fisher, Individual Member In working with organisations to advance media research and development, I appreciate IPTC standards as a valuable starting point for data interchange and search. Pam Fisher, Individual Member The IPTC Standards continue to provide us the solid foundations we need to enhance our products and services. Alex Maragoudakis, Reuters News Agency We joined IPTC to learn about technology and standards in the news industry, and to learn about trends and future work in the field of metadata. Alexandre Rouxel, European Broadcasting Union (EBU) Having access to, and being able to contribute to, the IPTC's work on standards and best practices is invaluable to NTB, in our continued quest to optimize our products towards our customers. Tor Kristian Flage, Norsk Telegrambyrå AS (NTB) The technical communications in IPTC meetings are great. We can know what is going on in other places around the world. Guowei Wu, 新华社 (Xinhua News Agency) I would say the number one value of IPTC to the NYT is networking and seeing what other media companies do. Jennifer Parrucci, The New York Times Company By being involved in the NewsCodes Working Group, I hear diverse views of tags and topics and get ideas and guidance for our own taxonomy and tagging processes. Jennifer Parrucci, The New York Times Company Our membership with IPTC gives us on one hand the opportunity to hear what’s going on at the technical side of the media industry, on the other hand to network within the industry. Robert Schmidt-Nia, DATAGROUP Access to IPTC materials and the broader IPTC community are extremely valuable resources that we utilize on an almost daily basis. Alex Maragoudakis, Reuters News Agency As we continue to evolve our metadata at Reuters, we hope to find greater opportunities to partner with the IPTC and utilize the group’s expertise to contribute to the news media landscape. Alex Maragoudakis, Reuters News Agency Being part of the IPTC Member community gives us the opportunity to discuss common issues, share experiences and find answers and/or partners to develop tools or solutions. Tor Kristian Flage, Norsk Telegrambyrå AS (NTB) IPTC Meetings are an important source for inspiration and updates on technology, trends or initiatives in the news industry. Tor Kristian Flage, Norsk Telegrambyrå AS (NTB) IPTC standards are created by media experts to help you solve your problems. But it’s not just about the standards: the key is to meet these experts in virtual or real-world meetings to discuss and to find solutions for technical challenges in the media industry. Gerald Innerwinkler, Austria Presse Agentur (APA) I definitely enjoy and feel I benefit greatly as a member of IPTC. I enjoy interacting with everyone in the video and photo metadata working groups enormously. It's so nice to speak with like-minded people every two weeks. Margaret Warren, Metadata Authoring Systems (Startup Member) Developing the News Architecture and related Standards in consultation with so many talented IPTC members continues to be hugely satisfying, especially seeing those Standards leveraged by members’ solutions. Dave Compton (Refinitiv, an LSEG business) In Refinitiv, the approaches, modelling and patterns used by the IPTC News Architecture and News Codes have informed solutions in other domains such as Risk. Dave Compton (Refinitiv, an LSEG business) IPTC membership reaches across organisations of all sizes, startups and individuals, enabling a pragmatic approach to standards definition, development and integration. Dave Compton (Refinitiv, an LSEG business) For TT Nyhetsbyrån NewsML-G2 is the base format of the editorial system, from event through planning to articles. NINJS is the base format for all items delivered, regardless of production system. And NewsML-G2 is option for customers who prefer XML.
