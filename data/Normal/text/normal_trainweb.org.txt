Promotion Update / Other FAQs We are in the process of reviewing and adding short descriptions of each website to the directory. As we examine each web site hosted at TrainWeb.org we are moving those that have not been updated for more than 5 years to TrainWeb.US . That is our archive web hosting platform where we preserve those web sites that still contain interesting photos and historical information. If you have a website hosted at TrainWeb.org, please be patient. We are trying to review at least 2 websites every day, so check back frequently to see what new websites have been updated in the above directory! As we examine each website those with the best quality and volume of content will be marked with a star. A filled star (★) highlighted in yellow indicates an active website with recent additions. An empty star (☆) highlighted in orange indicates a website that has not been updated recently, but still has a good volume of quality content. A website highlighted in orange but without a star just indicates that it has been moved to the TrainWeb.US archive, but does not have an extensive amount of information or photos. Websites that are functional but exhibit any sort of serious technical problems will be marked with a ☡ caution symbol. If you are the web master of one of these websites, please correct the problems with your website. A website marked with a Δ is a new website that might not yet have any content posted. Websites marked with a ☓ and highlighted in red are pending deletion due to no content ever having been posted or other serious problems.
