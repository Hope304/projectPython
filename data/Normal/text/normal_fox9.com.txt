This year, they’re expecting big crowds for the warmest opening weekend on record for Adele’s. The custard is the same recipe they’ve had since 1986 though they’ve added new flavors to the menu. The custard is made fresh every day. Unlike ice cream, the air is whipped out of it instead of put into it and it’s made with egg yolks which gives it a velvety texture. Adele’s will be open daily from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. through the day before Thanksgiving. 4 days ago video Bar airing women's sports opening in Minneapolis 5 days ago video AHS teaches kids about pet body language 5 days ago video FOX 9 Coffee Break at Tapestry Coffee 6 days ago video Scandinavian Folk Music at the American Swedish Institute 6 days ago video Winter flower show at Como Zoo and Conservatory 6 days ago Cannabis View More Frequent marijuana use linked to increase in heart attack and stroke risk Researchers in a new study explain that cannabis use, whether smoked, vaped, or ingested, can raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. 4 days ago Cannabis Expungement Board Director named by Gov.
