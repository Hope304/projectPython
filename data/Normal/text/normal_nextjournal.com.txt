Improve your workflow with polyglot notebooks, automatic versioning and real-time collaboration. Save time and money with on-demand provisioning, including GPU support.ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èTry instantlyüéüSign upMachine LearningData ScienceRunnable TutorialsClassroomScientific PublishingML researchers start training models on GPUs within minutes. When using machines with GPUs, we save time on setup by loading GPU drivers automatically. Once training is done, the instance is shut down automatically to avoid additional cost.Data Scientists connect external data sources securely and use familiar visualization libraries like Vega, Plotly or matplotlib. Notebooks can be collaborated on in real-time and shared privately or published to the whole internet.Library authors publish their documentation as notebooks containing runnable samples next to the text. Readers can remix these notebooks and experiment with the samples on their own.Professors provide notebooks as coursework with runnable exercises to their students. Students don‚Äôt waste time on setting up their local environment.Scientists can argue from evidence and increase trust by providing a reproducible, runnable analysis, including all raw data to be verified and built upon by peers. DOIs are provided upon request.Try Nextjournal nowGet started with Nextjournal now.Sign upSign up is free. You can import your existing Jupyter, IPython and RMarkdown notebooks.Full support & templates for common programming environmentsPythonRJuliaClojureTensorflowKerasPytorchBashWork togetherin real-timeGroups & CollaboratorsCreate public or private groups to work with your collaborators under a shared profile or invite them on a per-notebook basis. Secrets can be shared among collaborators.Real-Time SyncAll edits to a Nextjournal notebook are commit-less and synchronized in real-time among connected clients. This allows editing of a notebook by multiple authors at the same time.Try Nextjournal nowRapid and full reusabilityRemix entire notebooksEnabled by immutability, ‚ÄúRemix‚Äù allows you to quickly build off a copy of any previously published notebook, including all of its dependencies.Create, share and reuse Docker imagesThe entire file system can be published as Docker image with a single click. These images can be pulled to run locally or reused in other Nextjournal notebooks.Try Nextjournal nowPolyglot NotebooksIn Nextjournal, you can use multiple programming language runtimes together in a single notebook. Values can be exchanged between runtimes using files.Easy-to-manage runtime statesRuntimes are Docker containers that are orchestrated by a separate ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù application. This allow resetting an individual runtimes state without affecting other runtimes.Arbitrary installationsNextjournal can install anything as long as a runtime offers Bash. Environment variables can be set for each runtime through a UI.Default environmentsWe offer default environments for various languages and use cases that come pre-populated with libraries for plotting, number crunching and more.Try Nextjournal nowAutomatic Provisioning & ShutdownEvery notebook that is run, gets its own compute instance provisioned automatically. We keep a pool of small runners around with 4GB of RAM per instance that will boot instantly. Larger instances are available on-demand. When your computation is done, we shut it down automatically to save costs on idling machines.Full GPU supportCurrently, we have full support for up to 8 NVIDIA Tesla K80, P100 or P100 Workstation GPUs per runtime with minimal setup necessary.Try Nextjournal nowData & Secrets ManagementConnect your dataBesides uploading files, Nextjournal notebooks can bring in private data from S3 and Google Cloud Storage. You can also clone private GitHub repositories or import images from Docker Hub.Secrets managementSecrets can be added to your account‚Äôs private secrets storage that lives outside notebooks and computational environments. Secrets are stored securely in Vault and can only be read by your profile.Try Nextjournal nowShare your workNotebooks can be published under a permanent URL that you can define, like:nextjournal.com/your-handle/your-titleYou can decide wether a published notebook is accessible by everybody or just your group‚Äôs members. Published notebooks are read-only but can be remixed by anyone who can see them.Share URLsIndependent from wether a notebook has been published yet, you can always generate a link to share a read-only version of a current draft.Try Nextjournal now‚ÄúHoly crap...
