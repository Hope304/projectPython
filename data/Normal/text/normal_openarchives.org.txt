The roots of OAI lie in the open access and institutional repository movements. Over time, however, the work of OAI expanded to promote broad access to digital resources for eScholarship, eLearning, and eScience. The Open Archives Initiative is no longer working on new projects but this website and the associated specifications continue to be maintained. OAI-PMH was first released in 2001 and remains widely used within library and academic communities. From OAI-ORE the vocabulary for aggregation and associated data model are most widely used. The ResourceSync specification is formally standardized as ANSI/NISO Z39.99-2017. See also the OAI news archive.
