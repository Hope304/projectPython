Start Here What is SSL and why do I need it? SSL (which stands for Secure Sockets Layer) is an encryption technology that creates an encrypted connection between a web server (Apache, IIS, Nginx) and a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) allowing for private information to be transmitted without eavesdropping, data tampering, and message forgery. SSL essentially protects credit card numbers and other information from malicious third-parties like criminal hackers and third-party service providers (Internet Service Providers). It also protects your site from malware and prevents others from injecting advertisements into your resources. An SSL certificate is recommended for every website to protect user privacy and prevent tampering. To enable SSL on your website, you will need to get an SSL Certificate and install it on your web server. What to look for in an SSL Provider To get an SSL Certificate, you need to verify your organization's identity (or domain control) with a certificate provider, generally known as a Certificate Authority. Certification authorities have to keep detailed records of what has been issued and the information used to issue it, and are audited regularly to make sure that they are following defined procedures. Every certificate authority has different products, prices, features, and levels of customer satisfaction. You will primarily want to compare the following when choosing a certificate authority: Product features - Does the certificate authority provide a certificate with the features you need? Support - Does the certificate authority offer quality customer support when you need it? Price - Is the certificate within your price range?
