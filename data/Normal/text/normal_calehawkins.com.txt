Hailing from Bemus Point, NY (population: 364), Hawkins has toured, written, and produced internationally with a wide array of artists and groups since 2012. His songs draw from experiences both real and surreal. Hawkins produces, engineers, and plays all the instruments (except strings) on his music. His first two full-length albums A River of Teeth and I Broke My Shoulders are out now via Switch Hit Records. Hawkins currently writes and produces music with Raveena, Arthur Moon, Joshua Thew, Garth, and many more. He has performed in four NPR Tiny Desk concerts (Raveena, Arthur Moon, Mxmtoon, and Amber Mark) and joined Charli XCX on SNL in 2022.
