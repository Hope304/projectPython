Vivo took the top spot, thanks to its success in the budget segment of the market. That's despite both companies selling fewer phones, owing to a 7 percent drop in the overall Chinese market, which is suffering the effects of a nationwide deflation. Meanwhile, Huawei saw its market share grow to 16.5 percent from 9.4 percent, thanks to the popularity of its home-grown Mate 60 series. Apple recorded a 15.7 percent market share, falling from 19 percent a year ago, according to Counterpoint's data. Overall growth is likely to remain in the red during Q1 2024 on muted spending and a few new product launches, said the analysts. Apple's ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå struggled during the first few weeks of the year for several reasons, according to Counterpoint. "Primarily, it faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi," said Senior Analyst Mengmeng Zhang. "Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now," he added. Apple resellers in China have been increasingly dependent on discounts to shift ‚ÄåiPhone 15‚Äå stock in a market that has entered a general malaise. The discounts followed Apple's own rare price reductions on its website ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in February. Apple sales in China dropped 13 percent to $20.8 billion in the quarter ended December, falling short of the $23.5 billion predicted by analysts, and forecasts for a quick improvement in 2024 do not look particularly optimistic.

In the app, tap and hold the chat bot's text response, and then tap Read Aloud. You can also play, pause, or rewind the readout. The feature, which is also available on the web version of ChatGPT, adds another layer of voice-based interaction, and builds on the existing Voice Chat feature, which gives users the option of speaking conversationally with the chat bot instead of typing. Read Aloud can speak 37 languages and can auto-detect the language of the text that it is reading. OpenAI says the feature should enhance accessibility for users with visual impairments or reading difficulties, such as dyslexia. It also hopes Read Aloud improves engagement by personalizing the interaction, while also supporting language learning. ChatGPT can now read responses to you. On iOS or Android, tap and hold the message and then tap ‚ÄúRead Aloud‚Äù. We‚Äôve also started rolling on web - click the "Read Aloud" button below the message. pic.twitter.com/KevIkgAFbG ‚Äî OpenAI (@OpenAI) March 4, 2024 As most people will know by now, ChatGPT is an AI-based chatbot that uses generative artificial intelligence to answer questions and provide advice on all manner of subjects. History is synced across devices, so you can see your ChatGPT interactions both on the web and on iOS devices, and it integrates the Whisper speech recognition system.

For context, the European Commission's investigation into Apple's practices started due to a 2019 complaint from Spotify over App Store policies. Spotify has long railed against Apple's 30 percent fee, and has complained that it is unfairly disadvantaged compared to Apple Music. In a blog post, Spotify says that the European Commission has sent a clear message that "Apple's behavior limiting communications to consumers is unlawful." Apple's rules muzzled Spotify and other music streaming services from sharing with our users directly in our app about various benefits--denying us the ability to communicate with them about how to upgrade and the price of subscriptions, promotions, discounts, or numerous other perks. Of course, Apple Music, a competitor to these apps, is not barred from the same behaviour. By requiring Apple to stop its illegal conduct in the EU, the EC is putting consumers first. It is a basic concept of free markets--customers should know what options they have, and customers, not Apple, should decide what to buy, and where, when and how. It is worth noting that the scope of the investigation in Europe has changed several times. While Spotify complained over Apple's ‚ÄåApp Store‚Äå fees and the requirement to use in-app purchase, the European Commission was unable to target Apple for those actions. Instead, the investigation ended up pertaining to Apple's anti-steering rules, and the rule that keeps Spotify from informing customers about lower prices on the web within the Spotify app. The European Commission decided that Apple's restrictions preventing developers from letting iOS users know about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside the app is "illegal under EU antitrust rules." The EC claims that Apple caused customers to "pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions." Spotify in its blog post further says that Apple has "routinely defied laws and court decisions in other markets," and that it is waiting for the next steps that will "clearly and conclusively address Apple's long-standing unfair practices." Spotify claims that it plans to continue to push against Apple until it is able to secure a "truly fair digital marketplace everywhere." Apple has been ordered to "remove the anti-steering provisions" and keep from repeating the infringement or adopting similar practices in the future. Apple plans to appeal the decision and has claimed that the EC's view is misguided and has been heavily influenced by Spotify's complaints. Spotify will soon be able to release an app outside of the ‚ÄåApp Store‚Äå with support for alternative app marketplaces coming to the EU in iOS 17.4, but the streaming music company has complained that Apple's plans do not comply with the DMA and that the changes coming in Europe are a "complete and total farce."

Personas and EyeSight are Vision Pro additions that many people have poked fun at since the headset's release. Personas are a digital representation of the user that's shown in video calls, while EyeSight uses an external display to show the Vision Pro wearer's eyes if there are other people in the room. Personas and EyeSight are aimed at making the Vision Pro less of an isolating experience, but neither has been particularly well-received. As we've previously shared, the visionOS 1.1 beta makes Personas look more realistic, and Apple's release notes provided with the ‚ÄåvisionOS‚Äå 1.1 release candidate offer more insight. Specific improvements have been made to hair and makeup appearance and neck and mouth representation, and these tweaks make a big difference. play Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.The update also apparently improves rendering of the eyes for EyeSight, which isn't something that was previously noticed during the beta testing period. EyeSight draws on the Persona feature to capture a person's eyes to show on the external display. Presumably the EyeSight feature now looks somewhat better on the Vision Pro headset, but that it's gone so under the radar suggests Apple still has more work to do. Other new features in the update include improvements for the virtual keyboard and the Mac virtual display. ‚ÄåvisionOS‚Äå 1.1 will be officially released as soon as this week.

From Apple's release notes: This update enables Siri to learn your preferred media service, so you no longer need to include the name of the media app in your request. With ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå 17.4, ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå will learn preferences and use those preferences to select apps. If you have YouTube Music, for example, you won't need to say "Play [song name] on YouTube Music" to bypass Apple Music, nor will you need to set YouTube Music as your default music service in the Home app. ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå already works this way on the iPhone and the iPad, and asks users for their preferred app when playing content for the first time. As ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå has been updated to set a preference automatically, Apple has removed the Home app option that let users select a default media service. Third-party apps that work directly with the ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå include YouTube Music, Deezer, Pandora, TuneIn, and iHeartRadio. Streaming music services need to support ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå for the feature to work, and not all do. Note that popular music service Spotify can play content through a ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå request on ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå, but it uses the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå to do so. Along with ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå support for a preferred music service, the ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå 17.4 update also includes performance and stability improvements. The ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå 17.4 software will see a release as soon as this week.

Mac users who opt to trade in an old machine can get between $120 and $1315, with the values increased from the prior $115 to $1070 range. Most of the trade-in values have seen only minor increases or have stayed the same, but the Mac Studio has driven values up. Apple is now offering up to $1315 when trading in a ‚ÄåMac Studio‚Äå, with the prior maximum at $1070. MacBook Pro - Up to $1000 (Up from $990) MacBook Air - Up to $550 (No change) MacBook - Up to $160 (Up from $150) iMac - Up to $440 (No change) iMac Pro - Up to $500 (No change) Mac mini - Up to $400 (Down from $410) Mac Studio - Up to $1315 (Up from $1070) Mac Pro - Up to $800 (Down from $900) Trade-in values vary based on the condition, year, and configuration of the Mac that's being traded in.

The M3 MacBook Air models that were introduced today include support for up to two 5K external displays when used in clamshell mode, a feature that is not currently available on the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the same M3 chip. With the two machines using the same M3 chip, it was not clear why the ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå has the feature while the MacBook Pro does not, but it is an issue that Apple plans to rectify. In the near future, a software update will add the option for the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro to drive two external displays when the lid of the machine is closed. Both the M3 ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå and the M3 MacBook Pro offer support for one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz when the display is open, and with the update, the M3 MacBooks will also be able to power two 5K external displays with a resolution of up to 60Hz. That is equivalent to the Studio Display, so users can expect to be able to run two of Apple's 5K displays in clamshell mode. The higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro models are already able to drive multiple displays, so this change only applies to the 14-inch MacBook Pro that has the M3 chip. This machine replaced the prior-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro, which Apple has now done away with.

Apple agreed to pay up to $14.4 million (CAD) to settle a class action lawsuit in Canada that alleged the company secretly throttled the performance of some iPhone models. Each affected customer who submits a claim will receive a payment of between $17.50 and $150 (CAD) from Apple, with the exact payout amount to be dependent on the total number of claims submitted. More information on how to submit a claim will be shared on the settlement website, but a specific timeframe has yet to be provided. The class includes any current or former resident of Canada (excluding Quebec) who owned and/or purchased an iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and/or iPhone SE with iOS 10.2.1 or later installed or downloaded, and/or an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 11.2 or later installed or downloaded, before December 21, 2017. A serial number will be required for each affected iPhone, according to CBC News. Apple has denied the allegations described in the lawsuit, and the settlement does not represent an admission of fault. The settlement allows for Apple to avoid the additional time and costs involved with continued litigation. Apple was sued in multiple Canadian provinces over iPhone battery throttling in 2018, including Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. The cases were filed shortly after Apple revealed that it had started throttling the maximum performance of some iPhone models with "chemically aged" batteries, when necessary, to prevent the devices from unexpectedly shutting down. Apple introduced this new power management system in iOS 10.2.1, but it initially failed to mention the change in that update's release notes, leading to public outcry. Apple eventually apologized about its lack of transparency, and temporarily lowered the price of iPhone battery replacements to $29 (USD) until the end of 2018. Apple agreed to pay up to $500 million (USD) to settle a similar class action lawsuit in the U.S., and payments started going out in January there.

The company has reworked the lineup and its pricing, phasing out the M1 machine from 2020 and discontinuing the 15-inch M2 ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå introduced in June 2023, so which model should you buy? The 2024 MacBook Air is available in 13.6- and 15.3-inch display sizes just like its predecessor, with the smaller model starting at $1,099 and the larger model starting at $1,299. The 13.6-inch ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå with the ‚ÄåM2‚Äå chip from 2022 remains in the lineup, now at a price of $999. This means that buyers have the choice between the 2022 ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå, its 2024 successor, and a big-screen variant of the 2024 model. It is also worth remembering that it is possible to shave at least $100 off the price of a new ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå directly from Apple with education pricing. Read on to find out about all of the differences between the ‚ÄåM2‚Äå and M3 ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå models to help you decide which model is best for you, as well as if it may be worth upgrading. M2 vs. M3 Chip The main upgrade offered by the ‚Äå2024 MacBook Air‚Äå models is the M3 chip. In benchmark tests, the M3 outperforms the ‚Äå‚ÄåM2‚Äå‚Äå by about 17% in single-core tasks and approximately 21% in multi-core tasks. In GPU performance measured by Metal benchmarks, the M3 exhibits a notable improvement of around 15% over the ‚Äå‚ÄåM2‚Äå‚Äå. ‚ÄåM2‚Äå Chip M3 Chip Based on A15 Bionic chip from iPhone 13 (2021) Based on A17 Pro chip from iPhone 15 Pro (2023) Enhanced 5nm node (N5P) 3nm node (N3B) 20 billion transistors 25 billion transistors 3.49 GHz CPU clock speed 4.05 GHz CPU clock speed Neural Engine 15% faster Neural Engine Support for AV1 decode New GPU architecture Dynamic Caching Hardware-accelerated ray tracing Hardware-accelerated mesh shading The M3 chip introduces an all-new GPU architecture. This architecture includes Dynamic Caching, a breakthrough feature that optimizes GPU memory allocation and utilization, adapting in real-time to varying task demands. This enhancement not only boosts graphics performance for intensive applications but also bolsters the chip's overall energy efficiency. This is particularly beneficial for graphics-heavy tasks like advanced video editing, 3D rendering, and gaming. It also features support for AV1 video decode to provide more efficient and higher-quality video from streaming services. Apple Silicon Buyer's Guide: Which Chip Should You Choose? Despite similarities in the 16-core Neural Engine between the ‚Äå‚ÄåM2‚Äå‚Äå and M3, the M3's adoption of a ‚Äå‚Äå3nm‚Äå‚Äå fabrication process leads to more efficient execution of machine learning and AI tasks. Additionally, the M3 maintains up to 24GB of unified memory, just like the ‚Äå‚ÄåM2‚Äå‚Äå, but leverages the new process for more efficient memory bandwidth utilization. One other notable difference between the ‚Äå‚ÄåM2‚Äå‚Äå and M3 chips is their energy efficiency. The ‚Äå‚Äå3nm‚Äå‚Äå fabrication process enables the M3 to achieve higher performance without a proportional increase in power consumption, making the chip particularly appealing for laptop users who value a balance between power and battery life. M2 vs. M3 Buyer's Guide: How Much Better Really Is M3? Overall, the M3 chip is a considerable upgrade from the ‚Äå‚ÄåM2‚Äå‚Äå, distinguished by its higher transistor count, improved performance in CPU and GPU tasks, and superior energy efficiency. While the M3 offers clear advancements, the extent of its superiority does not necessitate an immediate upgrade for current ‚Äå‚ÄåM2‚Äå‚Äå users, especially if their existing workflows are still completed comfortably. For new buyers or those upgrading from older models, the M3's improvements in performance and efficiency will be much more pronounced. Other Differences There are a number of other notable differences between the two ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå generations beyond their chips. While these upgrades are fairly small, they are worth bearing in mind when contemplating whether to get the latest model. ‚ÄåM2‚Äå ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå (2022 and 2023) M3 ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå (2024) Available with 13.6-inch display only, 15.3-inch model discontinued Available with both 13.6- and 15.3-inch display size options Support for one external display Support for up to two external displays when the lid is closed Voice Isolation and Wide Spectrum microphone modes Enhanced voice clarity in audio and video calls Wi-Fi 6 support Wi-Fi 6E support Anodization seal to reduce fingerprints with Midnight finish Starts at $999 Starts at $1,099 Final Thoughts Overall, the M3 ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå is a minor upgrade over its predecessor, largely focusing on enhanced performance rather than new capabilities. Its main target audience is those who have an older ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå, such as an ‚ÄåM1‚Äå or Intel-based model, or no ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå at all. Unless you can leverage the specific advantages of the M3 chip and require maximum performance from its highly portable form factor, it is likely not worth buying the M3 ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå over the ‚ÄåM2‚Äå ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå for most users. However, if future-proofing is a major priority because you tend to keep your computer for many years, the extra $100 to get the latest model will probably be warranted. The M3 model's support for two external displays may also justifiably swing your buying decision if you have multiple monitors. If you plan to buy a new ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå from Apple and want the larger, 15.3-inch model, then the latest M3 model is your only option as the ‚ÄåM2‚Äå 15.3-inch machine has now been discontinued. That being said, the ‚ÄåM2‚Äå 15.3-inch ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå is still readily available second-hand, refurbished, and from third-party retailers for prices well below the $1,299 price of the latest model. If you want the larger model, it may be worth seeking out one of these deals on an ‚ÄåM2‚Äå model before opting for the latest M3 machine directly from Apple. It is certainly not worth upgrading from the ‚ÄåM2‚Äå to the M3 ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå for the overwhelming majority of customers. Upgrading from an ‚ÄåM2‚Äå 13-inch ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå to an M3 15-inch ‚ÄåMacBook Air‚Äå may be more justifiable owing to the display size increase, but there is little that the latest generation meaningfully offers over its predecessor.
