Deadline: 11 March, 9AM GMT Read more This week in data: This week, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) ‚Äì the UK‚Äôs official advisor ‚Äì issued ‚Äúunequivocal‚Äù advice to the government that the ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù from previous carbon budgets should not be carried forward, reported Carbon Brief. The UK overachieved on its carbon budget for 2018-22, leaving it with an emissions ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù ‚Äì but this was largely down to external factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic rather than policies, the CCC said. It warned that carrying the emissions surplus over could allow the UK‚Äôs emissions to rise by 15% (red line on the chart) during the fourth carbon budget period of 2023-27.
