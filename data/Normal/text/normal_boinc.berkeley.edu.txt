BOINC Compute for Science Compute for Science Language BOINC lets you help cutting-edge science research using your computer. The BOINC app, running on your computer, downloads scientific computing jobs and runs them invisibly in the background. It's easy and safe. About 30 science projects use BOINC. They investigate diseases, study climate change, discover pulsars, and do many other types of scientific research. The BOINC and Science United projects are located at the University of California, Berkeley and are supported by the National Science Foundation. START COMPUTING!To contribute to science areas (biomedicine, physics, astronomy, and so on) use Science United. Your computer will help current and future projects in those areas.
