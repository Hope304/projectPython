"I was interested in taekwondo and so I did it all the way until I was age 11 and I got my black belt. But then my mother still wanted me to dance and in between she made me do ice skating. I liked it, but I was not so good at it. And then my father stepped in and said, 'Why don't you try fencing?' Fencing is like the ballet of sports, it is very elegant and I really, really liked it."Learn more→Davide DI VEROLIWhen and where did you begin this sport?He took up the sport at age seven.Why this sport?His sister began practising fencing, so he wanted to do the same.Learn more→FoilLee KIEFERWhen and where did you begin this sport?She began fencing at age six after seeing her father fence at a local competition. "My siblings and I thought the sport was strange and interesting-appearing, so my dad started teaching us the basics in our empty dining room and taking us to a club twice a week that was 1.5 hours away from where we lived."Why this sport?She and her brother and sister followed their father, Steve Kiefer, into the sport. "Growing up my dad decided that he wanted to take up fencing again. He hadn't picked up a foil in 10 or 15 years, and me and my siblings watched him compete at a local tournament. Then he asked if we wanted to try it, and we said yes. Twenty years later I'm still doing it."Learn more→Ka Long CHEUNGWhen and where did you begin this sport?He took up the sport in the fourth grade at primary school.Why this sport?"My parents were both basketball players, so it was only natural I followed in their footsteps during my early years. All the basketball classes were suspended during the long holidays when I was probably in primary four. My father asked if I would be interested in taking a fencing course so that I could get some exercise and kill some time during the break. I thought about it for a while before saying yes."Learn more→SabreSara BALZERWhen and where did you begin this sport?She took up the sport at age eight and began competing in 2010.Why this sport?She followed her sister into the sport.Learn more→Sandro BAZADZEWhen and where did you begin this sport?He began fencing at age 13.Why this sport?"This sport is the sport of my family. My father, my brother - they were all engaged in fencing. And I also really wanted to be on a par with them. At first I played football, but once I happened to be at the Georgian fencing championship, and I liked what my brother and father did. It was love at first sight."Learn more→Results & CompetitionsLatest ResultsCompetitionDateWeaponGenderCatCairo2024-03-05foilMjuniorCairo2024-03-05epeeFjuniorCairo2024-03-05sabreFjuniorCairo2024-03-04foilFjuniorCairo2024-03-04epeeMjuniorView more results→Upcoming CompetitionsCompetitionDateWeaponGenderCatCairo2024-03-05foilMjuniorCairo2024-03-05epeeFjuniorCairo2024-03-05sabreFjuniorCairo2024-03-06epeeFjuniorCairo2024-03-06epeeMjuniorView more results→FIE YouTube05 September 2018Now playingWuxi 2018 Fencing Magazine show21 March 2018Now playingFencing Magazine show - Doha15 March 2018Now playingFencing Magazine show 1st round 2017-1822 August 2017Now playingLEIPZIG 2017 MAGAZINE SHOWOlympic channelSocial WallTwitterInstagramFacebookNever miss a momentStay in touch with all things fencing→Contact UsDonateTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySubscribe© 2017 FIE International Fencing Federation.
