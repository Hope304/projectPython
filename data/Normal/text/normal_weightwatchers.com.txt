What’s new? Our updated, simplified weight-loss program makes it easier for you to follow and find success. Every member gets a tailored Points Budget and streamlined list of over 200 ZeroPoint® foods. Compared to programs of the past, we now use advanced nutrition science to factor in more food label data, like added sugars, fiber, and unsaturated fats, to guide you toward the healthiest foods.What foods will I eat on the program?What you eat is up to you—and we’ll show you how to enjoy your favorite foods in a way that gets you to your goals. With WeightWatchers, there are no “good” or “bad” foods—just nutritious and less nutritious ones. What do I have to do to get the results I want?We make it as easy as possible. You’ll get a Points® Budget to “spend” however you want. You’ll track your meals, drinks, and snacks in the WW app and enjoy as many ZeroPoint® foods as you'd like. Activity can also boost your weight loss (vs. only focusing on food)ᶿᶿ.ᶿᶿ Johns DJ, Hartmann-Boyce J, Jebb SA, Aveyard P; Behavioural Weight Management Review Group.

JAMA Network Open. 2022;5(8):e2226561. Funded by WW International, Inc.Do I have to track everything? Science shows food tracking is the biggest predictor of success—the more you track, the more weight you’ll lose! But we’re all about consistency over perfection: It’s better to track some food most days of the week than every single thing you eat only some days of the week. In other words, perfection is not required. You’ll quickly decide how to approach tracking in a way that works for you. Here are some of our best tracking tips. What are ZeroPoint® foods?They are nutritional powerhouses that serve as the foundation of healthy eating and support your overall health. ZeroPoint foods also add bulk and flavor to meals, without costing Points® from your Budget, so you don’t have to weigh, measure, or track these foods—no matter how many you eat in a day! Those 200-plus foods include non-starchy veggies, fruit, eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese, fish, shellfish, chicken and turkey breast, and more.Who are WeightWatchers experts?Our team includes nutrition and behavioral scientists, registered dieticians, clinical researchers, and more. Together they help you overcome common weight-loss hurdles—like stress-eating or late-night snacking—while our exclusive Points system makes nutrition easier—so easy that healthier eating will feel like second nature. After you sign up, you’ll answer a few questions to get a plan customized for you, and build healthy habits with proven behavior change techniques.What are Workshops? Our Workshops (or Meetings, back in the day) are coach-led group sessions held in a Studio location or online. You don’t need to go, but the extra support can ramp up your results: Workshop members lose two times more weight than those who DIY.^ Workshops offer unlimited accountability, and give you a sense of belonging alongside coaches and members who really get it.^^Based on a 6-month multicenter trial.
