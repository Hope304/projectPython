I've owned MANY pickups of all kinds from many, MANY different winders but there is something special going on with these! I could yap about 'em all day. They really are special. Unique, yet familiar at the same time. I try explaining it, but it's one of those "Ya gotta be there" type of things. The first time I struck a chord, I said (out-loud, mind you LOL) "Holy shit!" That's a first! It absolutely cemented you as a top winder immediately in my mind. Not one these fly-by-night guys who just copy pickups. You got the quality and the ear to carve out your own niche in the market. THANK YOU! -Mike, NJI'm really digging my Tyson ToneLab P90s! Great pick-ups, they clean up nice, and have all the crunch I've been wanting out of my LP Special with distortion. Ordering them was a great experience too. A pleasure to do business with! -Alex, Nazareth PAHey! I received the pickup today and just finished wiring it in! Sounds friggin great!!!!!! Thank you so much I definitely made the right choice!...Thank you again for a great product, super fast turn around and just doing what you do! -DW, Buffalo NYFinally got the 60 set installed. Very nice. The bridge has a nice grind. The neck cleans up real nice. Bass not so flubby as stock, much tighter. Well done. -Matt, Stockton CAContactemail: tysontonelab@gmail.com Proudly powered by WordPress | Theme: TheShop by aThemes.
