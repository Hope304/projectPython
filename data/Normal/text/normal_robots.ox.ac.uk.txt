Information Engineering Main/Home Page Information Engineering In the Department of Engineering Science Welcome to Information Engineering Established by Professor Sir Michael Brady in 1985, the Robotics Research Group brought together a group of like-minded engineers working in robotics research and artificial intelligence. Now known as Information Engineering, it is currently composed of seven research groups whose interests range from machine learning to mobile robotics. Active Vision Machine Learning Foerster Lab for AI Research Machine Learning, Data Science and Decisions Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI) Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab (A2I) Dynamic Robot Systems Group (DRS) Torr Vision Visual Geometry Information Engineering is located in the Engineering Science triangle, principally in the purpose-built Information Engineering Building (opened in 2004).
