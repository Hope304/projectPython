I use it daily on PC and mobile. Includes VPN and virus protection. The other method is to use 2-step authentication. Preferably both. Be safe. Bless you.– Matti Hirvonen @Hiljaa_TuleeRemember to always protect your internet connections. An easy way to do this is to use a trusted and paid VPN service. I recommend @FSecure's VPN, because it's made by a cybersecurity company, which only purpose is to safeguard the data and privacy of its customers. #InfoSec– Veli Uotila @VeliUotilaTechradarHighly recommended for great value.
