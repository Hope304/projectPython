DIAL does not have any significant impact on the second-screen's battery life and the only requirement is that both first and second-screens are connected to the same home network.For device manufacturers, DIAL increases usage of applications on their first-screen products (TV, set-top, Blu-ray, etc.).For app developers, DIAL helps link their second-screen app to their first-screen app without requiring a manual launch or pairing process by the user.See the DIAL Protocol Specification for more discussion of typical use cases. © 2023 Netflix, Inc.Report abusePage detailsPage updated Report abuse
