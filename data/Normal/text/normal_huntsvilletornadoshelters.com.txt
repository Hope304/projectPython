Reply Santiago Bonilla says: October 7, 2013 at 8:44 pm I’m puertorrican, we are a 100 x 35 miles island with a 60% population living near tsunami risk coasts and the whole island under hurricane, storms and bad weather year round. There is a big market for your product here and no body is taking it seriously. We have a lot of companies selling security for doors, windows, etc., but no body cares about tsunamis and sudden floods. I believe in your product and I’m really positive about your company succsess if expanding to our island. If you are interested in expanding your company toward the Caribbean, just let talk.Loading...
