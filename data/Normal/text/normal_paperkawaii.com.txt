From The Author: Chrissy Pushkin This website has been created so that I can teach you how to make origami – the Japanese art of paper folding. The word Origami is a Japanese word – 折り, which is the combination of the words Ori 折り – to fold and Kami 紙 – which means paper. As well as some traditional models, I try my best to make tutorials for more unique and original designs. Coming up with new origami designs is something I really enjoy doing in my spare time. The origami instructions are often video tutorials, because I find that it is the easiest way to learn origami and for me to teach it to you. You will find lots of tutorials on how to make paper boxes, bows, envelopes, mini books, flowers, butterflies, Japanese characters like Totoro and Hello Kitty, there are simple instructions for beginners and challenging designs for advanced folders too.
