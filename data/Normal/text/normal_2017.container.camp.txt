This means demonstrating our commitment to open source technologies through integration in our tools, platforms, and solutions. With Microsoft Azure, you can work with the open-source tools you know for container orchestration, whether that’s Docker Swarm, Mesos-based DC/OS, or Kubernetes.We expose the API endpoints for our orchestration engine so the popular tools are compatible with Azure Container Service and, in most cases, will work out of the box. There’s no need to change your existing management practices to move container workloads to the cloud.We look forward to engaging with technologists from Australia and Asia at Container Camp Sydney to share the capabilities of open source on Azure.community PartnersHomeSpeakersScheduleLocationBlogYouTubeTwitterContactCode of ConductStay in touch by signing up to our newsletterOur Previous CampsAU 2017UK 2016USA 2016UK 2015USA 2015UK 2014
