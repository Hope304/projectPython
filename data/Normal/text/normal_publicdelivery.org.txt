Our mission is to push the limits of how art can change the world. We collaborate with recognized artists, art spaces, and organizations to create an active archive of ideas and provide tools for artistic research. We focus specifically on overlooked and underrepresented communities, particularly those in remote places far from the usual spheres of the art world. In our various collaborations, we have spearheaded projects such as Asia’s tallest mural and a pop-up exhibition that opened on the same weekend on six continents. Recently, we have focused our efforts on the global performance project Silence Was Golden. So far, we have produced over 400 performances and 40 exhibitions in 105 countries. In 2018, we became the most visited online not-for-profit arts organization. About Magazine Projects … Stay in touch We would love to keep the conversation going.
