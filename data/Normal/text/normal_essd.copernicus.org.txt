Sci. Data, 16, 1167–1176, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-1167-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-1167-2024, 2024 Short summary Short summary Gravity gradient tensor, a set of six unique gravity signals, is suitable for detecting undersea features. However, due to poor spatial resolution in past years, it has received less research interest and investment. However, current datasets have better accuracy and resolutions, thereby necessitating a revisit. Our analysis shows comparable results with reference models. We conclude that current-generation altimetry datasets can precisely resolve all six gravity gradients.

In this context, a new high-resolution (1 / 10°) data-driven dataset of 3D ocean currents has been developed within the European Space Agency World Ocean Circulation project, providing 10 years (2010–2019) of horizontal and vertical quasi-geostrophic currents at daily resolution over the North Atlantic Ocean, down to 1500 m depth. Hide 26 Feb 2024 Laboratory data linking the reconfiguration of and drag on individual plants to the velocity structure and wave dissipation over a meadow of salt marsh plants under waves with and without current Xiaoxia Zhang and Heidi Nepf Earth Syst.

We showed that leaves contribute to most of the total plant drag and wave dissipation. Plant resistance significantly reshapes the velocity profile and enhances turbulence intensity. Adding current obviously impact the plants' wave decay capacity. The dataset can be reused to develop and calibrate marsh-flow theoretical and numerical models.

Here, 37 years (1982–2018) of monthly ET component data for the TP was produced, and the data are consistent with measurements. The annual average ET for the TP was about 0.93 (± 0.037) × 103 Gt yr−1. The rate of increase of the ET was around 0.96 mm yr−1. The increase in the ET can be explained by warming and wetting of the climate.

We used satellite images and focused on the crop status during the dry conditions. We found that 23.4 % of global cropland is irrigated, with the most extensive areas in India, China, the US, and Pakistan. We also explored the distribution of central pivot systems, which are commonly used in the US and Saudi Arabia. This new map can better support water management and food security globally.

To better understand glacial–interglacial differences between the tropical WPWP and high-latitude climate change, we compare our WPWP stack to global and North Atlantic deep-ocean stacks. Although we see similar timing in glacial–interglacial change between the stacks, the WPWP exhibits less amplitude of change.

CIrrMap250 showed superior performance than the existing products. CIrrMap250 revealed that China’s irrigated area has increased by about 180,000 km2 from 2000 to 2020, with the majority being water-unsustainable and occurring in regions facing high to severe water stress.

Gambier Island is a key black pearl producer and the study goal was to understand the processes influencing spat collection of pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera, the species used to produce black pearls. The data set is provided to address local pearl farming questions and other investigations as well.

This is known as ocean acidification. We merged 10 years of ocean carbon data and made them publicly available for adaptation planning during a time of change. The data confirmed that Alaska is already experiencing the effects of ocean acidification due to naturally cold water, high productivity, and circulation patterns.

However, current remote sensing datasets of these variables come mostly at coarse resolutions, and the few high-resolution datasets available have large gaps due to cloud cover. Here, we present a continuous daily product for both variables across Europe for 2018–2019 obtained by combining observations from geostationary as well as polar-orbiting satellites.

Tephra enables the synchronisation of these lake records and their proxy reconstructions to absolute timescales. The data incorporate geochemical data from tephra layers across 19 varve lake records. We highlight the potential for synchronising multiple records using tephra layers across continental scales whilst supporting reproducibility through accessible data.

Although net fluxes are small in many countries, they are often composed of large compensating emissions and removals. In many countries, the estimates agree well once their individual characteristics are accounted for, but in other countries, including some of the largest emitters, substantial uncertainties exist.

Only a few sites in the Arctic perform long-term measurements of the surface radiation budget (SRB). At the Thule High Arctic Atmospheric Observatory (THAAO, 76.5° N, 68.8° W) in Northern Greenland, solar and infrared irradiance measurements were started in 2009. These data are of paramount importance in studying the impact of the atmospheric (mainly clouds and aerosols) and surface (albedo) parameters on the SRB.

This study, based on interpolated observations, reconstructs the longest global time series of coastal FCO2 (1982–2020). Results show the coastal ocean acts as a CO2 sink, with increasing intensity over time. This new coastal FCO2-product allows establishing regional carbon budgets and provides new constraints for closing the global carbon cycle.

Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2023-459,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2023-459, 2024 Preprint under review for ESSD (discussion: final response, 5 comments) Short summary Short summary In Saint-Malo, France, an initiative to enhance marine submersion prevention began in 2018. Shom conducted an extensive sea campaign, mapping the bay's topography and exploring coastal processes. High-resolution data improve knowledge of the interactions between waves, tide and surge, and determine processes responsible for submersion. Beyond science, these findings contribute crucially to a local warning system, providing a tangible solution to protect the community from coastal threats.

We proposed a framework for generating the first global 500 m daily seamless data cubes (SDC500), covering the period from 2000 to 2022. We believe that the SDC500 dataset can interest other researchers who study land cover mapping, quantitative remote sensing, and ecological science.

This study introduces the VISEA algorithm, which integrates satellite data and shortwave radiation to provide daily 0.05° gridded near-real-time ET estimates. By employing a vegetation index-temperature method, this algorithm can estimate ET without requiring additional data. Evaluation results demonstrate VISEA's comparable accuracy with accelerated data availability.
