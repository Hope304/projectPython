SPEC develops benchmark suites and also reviews and publishes submitted results from our member organizations and other benchmark licensees. What's New: March 4, 2024: ICPE 2024 - Call for Participation (Early Registration until March 15, 2024): Registration is open for the full conference (3-day conference, workshops, tutorials) or Workshops and Tutorials only. Registration deadlines are Early: March 15, 2024, Regular: April 12, 2024 and Late/Onsite: May 11, 2024. 15th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering Supported by ACM SIGMETRICS, SIGSOFT, and SPEC RG. February 22, 2024: SPEC has released a new version of the PTDaemon interface, the software that allows power measurement devices to be incorporated into performance evaluation software. PTDaemon greatly simplifies power and temperature benchmarking with SPEC benchmarks, eliminating the need to understand and adapt to different power analyzer interface protocols and behaviors. February 20, 2024: Registration is now open for the Fifteenth ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE), taking place May 7-11, 2024, in London. November 9, 2023: SPEC announced the availability of the SPECaccel 2023 benchmark suite, a major update to the SPEC ACCEL v1.4 benchmark, that measures the performance of key system components using computationally intensive parallel applications running under the OpenACC and OpenMP target offloading APIs. October 30, 2023: SPEC announced that EEMBC, the 25-year-old Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium, has become SPEC's new Embedded Group (SPEC EG). EEMBC is known for developing industry-standard benchmarks for measuring the performance and energy efficiency of embedded processor hardware and software used in autonomous driving, mobile imaging, the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile devices, and more. The addition of EEMBC broadens SPECâ€™s portfolio with more than 15 highly regarded benchmarks for embedded computers and enables both organizations to share workloads and infrastructure costs to allow for more investment in research and development. July 25, 2023: SPECapc has released the SPECapc for Creo 9 benchmark. The updated benchmark offers performance measurement for computing systems running PTC Creo 9. Creo is a popular 3D CAD solution that includes support for generative design, real-time simulation, advanced manufacturing, industrial IoT and augmented reality. June 26 2023: This year's ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering marked an exciting return to an in-person conference, and nearly 150 attendees enjoyed three keynote speeches, 28 research presentations, seven data challenge presentations, a range of workshops and more. June 26, 2023: SPEC HPG Search program - SPEC is seeking to encourage those outside of SPEC to assist us in locating applications that could be used in the next SPEC high performance computing benchmark suite.
