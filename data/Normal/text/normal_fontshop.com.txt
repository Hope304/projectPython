FontShop | The world’s best fonts for print, screen and web English Deutsch “As Gerrit Noordzij once said: ‘Only when you know where you come from you can say where you want to go.’ And so it goes on with FontShop, now as the shop has moved to MyFonts. “Shop” is only the second syllable of FontShop, the first being “Font”. And that’s what this page will continue to be about: all the FontFonts and font innovations that FontShop has created in 25 years.” Erik Spiekermann, Founder of FontShop Shop FontFonts at MyFonts Try Monotype Fonts for free On any questions regarding your customer account please refer to our help pages FAQ.
