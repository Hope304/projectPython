We believe there is no such thing as a closed platform. We believe software was meant to be liberated. And we believe we are the liberator. We believe in making money so that we can keep going. But we also believe in giving back. And we also believe we need to prove it. Because we believe people are smart enough to smell bullshit when theyâ€™re stepping in it. We believe in breaking stupid rules that get in the way of great software. We believe that users have the right to experience software the way the developer intended, no matter where they are, what platform they use, or what hardware they own. We believe in building up the open source community. We believe in building up the next generation of talent. We believe the best people will be attracted to the greatest causes. And we donâ€™t care what the popular kids think. We believe in doing hard things because they are hard. We believe in taking our mission seriously, and ourselves less seriously. We believe that makes us fun to be around. Just because we believe we need to work with the world as it is, doesnâ€™t mean we donâ€™t believe in the possibility of a better one.

We're misfits. But mostly, we're software liberators. And we're very, very good at what we do. We have to be. Lots of developers work with open source, but only a tiny fraction of those are good enough to get software that was designed for one platform to work on another one. We invented CrossOver software - a unique approach to cross-platform compatibility that does not require dual-boot or another OS license. We launched PortJump to help app and game developers broaden their market beyond WindowsÂ® users. And we launched ExecMode to help organizations solve really ugly technical challenges.
