Activities with Rigor and Coherence ARCs are Activities with Rigor and Coherence that span grades K-8. Each ARC is a series of lessons that addresses a mathematical topic and demonstrates the vision of Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All. Reasoning and Sense Making Task Library In order for high school students to be engaged in reasoning and sense making in the classroom, the task—what students are asked to do—is critical. While linking the task directly with NCTM's Focus in High School Mathematics: Reasoning and Sense Making, NCTM's Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, and the Common Core State Standards, each item addresses task design, teaching design and student engagement. NCTM is committed to offering standards-based resources that improve the teaching and learning of mathematics for each and every student.
