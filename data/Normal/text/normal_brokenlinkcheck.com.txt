They commended: Find and fix problems the easy way! This free Link Checker not just validates your site and tells you which web references on your pages are dead, but it will also show to you where exactly those stale hyperlinks locate in your HTML code, highlighting problematic tags. This unique feature makes our web domain checking service stand out among other available problem detection tools - by making it so easy for webmasters to find bad URLs and clean them up in no time.It's never been so easy to locate and fix dead weblinks! Our on-line website validation tool reports only things that are really broken - unlike other popular solutions that list both good and bad hyperlinks all mixed together, making it very hard to comprehend and work with such "noisy" information. Also, this linking problem finder analyses the entire site - its web-content as a whole, keeps track of issues already reported, and doesn't repeat the same invalid URL unless you ask about it specifically: this free URL Checker tool is very flexible! Why having broken links is so bad? 404 and similar errors on websites are not just annoying â€“ those may cause some real damage to your online business as well as to your reputation in the Internet! Because of dead hyperlinks, a web-site may: Lose some of the existing client base (current users sooner or later will get frustrated enough with Page Not Found messages to never come back) Get problems with acquiring new customers (because of the dead weblinks people simply won't be finding things/pages they are looking for). Damage your reputation online (most visitors consider errors like that to be a sign of laziness and disrespect to them) Negatively impact your website ranking with major search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc. All that presents an issue so serious that people sometimes say "link rot" referring to it: as you may already know, "rotten" weblink is just another name for the same "dead URL" thing. What is the nature of invalid hyperlinks? With the growth of web content, it's getting harder and harder to manage relations between individual webpages and keep track of weblinks within the site. Unfortunately, there are no perfect website integrity tools or services that can check and enforce a proper relationship between pages, keep records of moved content / renamed webpages / subdomains added, and update each corresponding URL automatically. With time this causes some of your internal links to become obsolete, stale, odd, dangling, and simply - dead because they don't lead to valid resources anymore. Modern content management systems (CMS like WordPress and Joomla) and blog software may aggravate the problem even more - by replicating the same internal broken links across numerous webpages which they generate dynamically so that people will see 'Page Not Found' messages much more frequently. Your visitors will encounter 404 error codes or other unsuccessful HTTP responses when trying to access those missing resources. With outbound references, the situation is even worse: the web-site you are linking to can change names and locations of their pages any time without any notice breaking previously working backlinks. Those external servers can be brought down (temporarily or forever) or their domains expire or be sold. Alas, you don't have any control over such things, so the only good remedy would be performing regular sanity tests probing every single outgoing reference making sure it's still alive and NOT pointing at some non-existing content. Why you need our online Link Checker Due to lack of adequate problem detection tools (aka URL validators, web spiders, HTML crawlers, website's health analyzers, etc.), it's very hard to identify what exact local and external (outbound) hyperlinks became dead returning 404 responses. It's even harder to fix those because for cleaning, you need to know the precise location of the broken linking tag in the HTML markup: without that, you will need to scan through thousands of source lines to find the exact HREF (or another subtag) in your code that causes the problem. This is exactly where our On-line Spider tool truly shines: it will crawl your entire site - check all pages searching for issues and will detect invalid webpage references on your website, telling you precisely where to fix those! For each bad hyperlink found (both internal and outgoing) you will see a screen that contains page source and highlights the actual HTML tag containing the non-working url, so you can correct the rot right away and eventually repair your blog very quickly. That way your customers won't be annoyed with 'Page Not Found' errors anymore when clicking your weblinks. As 100% online tool running in the Internet, our free Website Scanner & Problem Detector can be used on any computer - Mac, PC, notebook / laptop / tablet, or even on a mobile device / smartphone, and with any Operating System - Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Apple iOS, Android, Linux, or UNIX.
