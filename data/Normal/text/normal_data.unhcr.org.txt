Read more Armenia Emergency In the last week of September 2023, following renewed hostilities in the South Caucasus region, refugees began arriving rapidly in Armenia. Within a week, some 100,000 refugees had crossed the border. They are in urgent need of protection and support. UNHCR teams have been on the ground and at the border since the earliest days, when the first groups of refugees arrived. UNHCR is providing immediate assistance and closely monitoring the situation, in support of the government-led response. Our priority is making sure civilians are protected and humanitarian assistance can reach those in need. In support to the government-led response, UNHCR is leading the interagency refugee response, working with the UN Resident Coordinators Office, as well as UN agencies and NGOs. It is important that the needs in the short term, as well as the medium to long term are considered. Read more Ukraine Refugee Situation The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has caused massive civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, forcing people to flee their homes seeking safety, protection and assistance. Since February 2022, millions of refugees from Ukraine have crossed borders into neighbouring countries, and millions more have been forced to flee within the country. They are in need of protection and support. In light of the emergency and the scale of humanitarian needs, an inter-agency regional refugee response is being carried out, in support of the efforts of refugee-hosting countries. The Regional Refugee Response Plan brings together national authorities, UN agencies, NGOs, as well as civil society organisations and focuses on supporting host country governments to ensure the inclusion of refugees, with full access to their rights, in line with international standards. It also prioritizes the provision of critical protection services and humanitarian assistance.

Hundreds of thousands of people have fled into neighbouring countries or returned home in adverse circumstances – notably to the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia and South Sudan. Others self-relocated within Sudan.

Initially, it was manifested primarily through higher consumption financed mainly by increased spending by the government and humanitarian organisations. Despite being forced to flee their homes, refugees from Ukraine very quickly entered the labour market as employees and entrepreneurs. In our study, we take a closer look at this phenomenon and analyse its economic impact on the Polish economy, comprehensively considering the supply side of the economy, including labour supply and productivity, and the demand side, estimating by how much this has collectively raised Polish GDP.
