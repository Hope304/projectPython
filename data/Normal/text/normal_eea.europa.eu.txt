Against the backdrop of soaring natural gas prices, 2022 witnessed a 2% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, driven by substantial decreases in the buildings and industrial sectors, while emissions from energy supply and transport saw an increase.To achieve the 2030 emission reduction target, the pace of annual reductions in Europe must more than double compared with the annual progress seen since 2005. More rapid reductions are particularly needed for the emissions from road transport, buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries. Reductions in energy consumption and growth of renewable energy must accelerate even faster to reach the 2030 targets.More on our Trends and Projections packageOur areas of workState of Europe's environmentNatureHealthClimateEconomy and resourcesSustainabilityAll topicsEEA in numbers38Member and cooperating countries400+National partner institutions200+Datasets280+EmployeesOur latest press releasesLoadingSee all press releasesAbout usFAQsCareersContact usSign up to our newsletterEnvironmental information systemsPrivacySitemapCMS Logintop
