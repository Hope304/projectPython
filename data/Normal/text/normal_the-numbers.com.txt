More... Weekend projections: Dune hits pay dirt with $81.5-million debut March 3, 2024 Dune: Part Two is headed for an excellent $81.5-million opening weekend, according to Warner Bros.â Sunday-morning projection. Thatâs a little higher than our modelâs Saturday-morning prediction of $79.4 million, and almost exactly double the first weekend earnings of Dune back in October, 2021. In addition to the strong top-line number, there are some early signs that the studio has a major hit on its hands. More... Saturday update: Dune shooting for $80-million debut after $32.2-million opening day March 2, 2024 After posting a respectable $12 million from previews on Thursday, Dune: Part Two added another $20.2 million during the âcalendar dayâ on Friday to post an excellent $32.2 million âopening day,â according to Warner Bros.. Thatâs just a shade behind our modelâs expectation, and brings our weekend prediction down closer to $80 million than $90 million. Read on for the detailsâ¦ More... Weekend prediction: Dune: Part Two set to spice up the box office March 1, 2024 Thereâs no question at all whether Dune: Part Two will top the box office chart this weekend, nor whether it will have the best opening weekend of the year so far. This is a film with loftier goals though. The real targets for the film are, at the low end, finishing Sunday as the highest-grossing movie of 2024, and, at the high end, breaking the psychologically important (and letâs face it, financially important) $100-million-opening barrier. Hereâs what our model has to say about that, plus another opening weekend for The Chosen. More... Theater Counts: Dune blasts into 4,071 theaters February 29, 2024 After two weeks as the most widely-available film in North America, Madame Web will take a backseat this week to the highly anticipated sci-fi epic feature, Dune: Part Two. The follow-up to 2021âs Dune, Dune: Part Two is set to begin its theatrical run in 4,071 movie houses, including IMAX and 70mm-format releases. Thatâs down a little from its predecessor, which debuted in 4,125 locations. More... The Numbers Business Report looks at how much an Oscar is worth February 29, 2024 With the Oscars coming up on March 10, the latest issue of The Numbers Business Report looks at how much Oscar nominations and wins are worth. The analysis includes a major update to our box office prediction model that now allows us to see how much our model thinks a film will have earned by the end of its run at any point after it has been released. It turns out that some films are helped a lot by a Best Picture nomination, and, even if they donât win the big prize, also get a boost from the telecast. Othersâ¦ not so much. Pick up a copy of the Report for details. More... Imaginary trailer February 28, 2024 Blumhouse horror movie starring DeWanda Wise and Pyper Braun opens exclusively in theaters on March 8 ... Full Movie Details. When Jessica moves back into her childhood home with her family, her youngest stepdaughter Alice develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named Chauncey she finds in the basement. Alice starts playing games with Chauncey that begin playful and become increasingly sinister. As Aliceâs behavior becomes more and more concerning, Jessica intervenes only to realize Chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be. More... Kung Fu Panda 4 trailer February 26, 2024 Animated adventure starring Jack Black opens exclusively in theaters on March 8 ... Full Movie Details. After three death-defying adventures defeating world-class villains with his unmatched courage and mad martial arts skills, Po, the Dragon Warrior, is called upon by destiny toâ¦ give it a rest already. More specifically, heâs tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace. That poses a couple of obvious problems. First, Po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet, and second, he needs to quickly find and train a new Dragon Warrior before he can assume his new lofty position. Even worse, thereâs been a recent sighting of a wicked, powerful sorceress, Chameleon, a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature, large or small. And Chameleon has her greedy, beady little eyes on Poâs Staff of Wisdom, which would give her the power to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit realm. So, Poâs going to need some help. He finds it (kinda?) in the form of crafty, quick-witted thief Zhen, a corsac fox who really gets under Poâs fur but whose skills will prove invaluable. In their quest to protect the Valley of Peace from Chameleonâs reptilian claws, this comedic odd-couple duo will have to work together. In the process, Po will discover that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places. More... Weekend projections: Bob Marley holds on at top of chart February 25, 2024 A lack of new releases with mass-market appeal will allow Bob Marley: One Love to stay top of the chart at the box office this weekend. The biopic is projected to decline a respectable 53% from the Friday-to-Sunday portion of its opening weekend to earn another $13.5 million on this outing. Thatâll take it to around $71 million in total after 12 days in release. Its closest challenger will be Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no YaibaâTo the Hashira Training, which will come in with an impressive $11.575 million debut. Ordinary Angels is doing good business in third place with a projected $6.5 million opening weekend. More...
