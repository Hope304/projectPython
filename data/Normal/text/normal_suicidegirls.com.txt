Pepperoni or any Italian sausage with fresh mushrooms is great, but there’re such great combinations. I also really like with canned tuna, pineapple and shrimp 😅 I know, but like to said I love pizza, hot and cold, with the classic Italian topings and some cooler ones, just no banana or chocolate or turn it into something weird and not savory. 16 mins 1 throat_punch: Pepperoni definitely but I’m one of those that occasionally likes pineapple on my pizza 11 mins helldunkes Photoset of the Day by fla 3 hrs 1999 Facebook Tweet Email 🥛Light snack...🥛 I went to the shopping center to film a video for YouTube, I wanted to work out in the gym, but I couldn’t find the strength.

Now I'm an adult and frames seem a little less whacky as the kiddies ones but one thing that really has changed is … VIEW 16 of 16 COMMENTS eisesara: I get lash extensions (on the top lashes) and tint my bottom lashes black so I don't have to put mascara on anymore. They just glue lashes in clusters. I get a more natural look so it costs about $50 and takes like half an hour. They last 3-4 weeks if you care for them (don't expose to water for 24 hours, use oil-free product, don't sleep on them, be gentle when removing eye shadow). This is what I look like without glasses, no makeup. I only do eye liner on the bottom lashes and eyeshadow on the lids. Nov 15, 2023 15 yiro: I have the same problem.. my miopia is pretty bad so magnifying mirrors don't really help. Also, they distort the image a bit and it makes me confused, the makeup always ends up looking weird. I'm considering contacts now, I hope it helps! 44 mins Load more We at SuicideGirls have been celebrating alternative pin-up girls for: 22 years 6 months 2 days 5,509,826 fans 41,393 fans 10,327,617 followers 4,466 SuicideGirls 1,164,677 followers 14,511,897 photos 321,315 followers 60,360,408 comments Join Profiles Groups Photos Videos Shop Help About Press LIVE Legal/Tos | DMCA | Privacy Policy | 18 U.S.C. 2257 Record-Keeping Requirements Compliance Statement | Contact Us | Vendo Payment Support ©SuicideGirls 2001-2024 Search Press enter to search Fast Hi-res TIP Click here to join & see it all...
