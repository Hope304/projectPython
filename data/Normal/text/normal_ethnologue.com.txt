We look at the number of endangered languages in the world today.How many languages are there in the world?Thousands of languages are spoken today. We dig into exactly how many there are, where they're from, their average size, and the 10 countries with the most languages.What is the most spoken language?We factor in both native and non-native speakers to determine the largest language in the world. Also includes our current list of the world's four most spoken languages.At a GlanceGeographyClickable world globe showing country outlines Demographics7.668 billion people7,164 languages430 million deaf86% literateLanguage Vitality CountInstitutional492Stable3593Endangered3072Extinct451DetailsThis graph shows the profile of languages in the world with respect to their level of language vitality.Institutional — The language has been developed to the point that it is used and sustained by institutions beyond the home and community.Stable — The language is not being sustained by formal institutions, but it is still the norm in the home and community that all children learn and use the language.Endangered — It is no longer the norm that children learn and use this language.Extinct - The language is no longer used and no one retains a sense of ethnic identity associated with the language.These four summary levels have been derived by grouping levels in the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS), which is the more fine-grained scale that Ethnologue uses to assess the status of every language in terms of development versus endangerment; see Language Status for a description of the levels of that scale. See also the pages on Development and Endangerment for more discussion.Recent ArticlesWelcome to the 27th editionAs our contribution to the celebration of International Mother Language Day, we are pleased to announce the release of the 27th edition of Ethnologue."Global Voice" InitiativeThe Global Voice (GV) initiative is a program launched by Ethnologue to improve the quality of the data that is available on the language ecologies of the world.ScriptsScripts used in the languages of the worldArabic Script[-arab]Cherokee Script[-cher]Khmer Script[-khmr]Data ContributorsMeet more contributors.Nate CheesemanNate has been a contributor since 2010 and has contributed over 2800 times.
