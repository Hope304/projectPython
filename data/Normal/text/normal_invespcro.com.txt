Jeremy Hambly Director of Marketing View All Case Studies THE INVESP STORY THIS AIN’T OUR FIRST RODEO In 2005, Ayat had just started freelancing on SEO and Usability. At the same time, Khalid was a software architect helping a Fortune 500 company build an ecommerce site. The site came with a “small” price tag of 35-million-dollars. The team launched the site – and visitors piled in. But in four weeks, the site generated a measly ten orders. Yes, ten orders for the thirty-five-million-dollar investment. This was not a unique story. Ayat was hearing clients struggle with improving their site conversion rates. No paid attention to improving sites – marketing teams were only focused on getting more and more visitors. Sitting at their kitchen table, Khalid & Ayat saw an opportunity. They could help companies avoid catastrophic failures. In 2006, Invesp was born – one of the first dedicated conversion rate optimization agencies.
