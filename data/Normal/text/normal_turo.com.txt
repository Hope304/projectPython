In France you must be 18 years old or older and have held a driver’s license for at least 2 years, longer for certain makes and models of vehicles. When you’re booking your first trip, you’ll go through a quick approval process by entering your driver’s license and some other information. In most cases, you’ll get approved immediately, and you’ll be set for all future road trips, day trips, and business trips! Do I need my own insurance?No, you don’t need personal insurance coverage to book a car on Turo.In the US, any personal insurance you may have that covers damage to the host’s vehicle would kick in before your Turo protection plan, except in limited situations for trips booked in Maryland. When booking a car in the US, you’ll choose between three protection plans — Premier, Standard, or Minimum — to get the level of protection that’s right for you. On each trip, you’re covered with third-party automobile liability insurance provided under a policy issued to Turo by Travelers Excess and Surplus Lines Company.*In New York state, you’ll also choose between Premier, Standard, or Minimum. With each plan, you’re covered with liability insurance of $1,250,000.* Protection plans for New York trips also include access to roadside assistance, priority phone support, and 24/7 customer assistance.When booking a car in Canada, you’ll choose between three protection plans — Premier, Standard, or Minimum — and with each plan, you’re covered with liability insurance purchased from Intact Financial Corporation in Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec, and Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) in British Columbia — up to $2,000,000 for all plans.**When booking a car in the United Kingdom, you’ll also choose between the Premier, Standard, and Minimum protection plans. Each plan includes different limits of financial responsibility for physical damage, but all three plans include up to £20,000,000 coverage under a third-party automobile liability insurance policy provided by Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance UK Ltd. via Turo broker Aon UK Ltd.**When booking a car in Australia, you’ll choose between the Premier (if available), Standard, and Minimum protection plans. Each plan includes varying limits on financial responsibility for damage to a host’s vehicle. All trips include $20,000,000 in legal liability protection for damage to other people’s property. All protection is provided by Turo Travels Mutual.***Can other people drive a car that I booked?Yes, multiple guests can drive the car you book on Turo, as long as they are all approved to drive. The primary driver (whoever booked the car) can add additional drivers with no fees or additional charges. Only the primary driver can request to add drivers; Turo hosts cannot do it for you. We encourage you to request to add additional drivers before your trip starts, though guests in the US and Canada can request to add a driver while a trip is in progress.To speed up the process, have your additional driver create a Turo account and get approved to drive before you request to add them. All drivers must have a valid driver’s license and meet the age requirements for the car you’ve booked. You can request to add drivers via the “Trips” tab in the Turo app without additional driver charges or extra costs.What is the cancellation policy on Turo?You can cancel and get a full refund up to 24 hours before your trip starts. If you book a trip with less than 24 hours’ notice, you have one hour after booking to cancel free of charge. If you cancel after the free cancellation period ends, you will be charged a small cancellation fee.In the rare event a host cancels, you’ll be notified immediately so you can book another car, or we’ll help you find one. Your refund can be temporarily held to expedite rebooking, or the funds can be returned to your bank account — your choice.What happens if I have an accident?If there’s an emergency or an issue with the car, call our emergency roadside assistance provider, available 24/7. We’ll make sure you’re safe, then help you get back on your way.Can I get my car delivered to me?Yes, many hosts offer delivery to travel hubs like airports, train stations, and hotels, or to custom delivery locations. There are cars available on Turo at convenient locations near hundreds of airports. Skip the rental counter and have your car delivered for pickup and return at your hotel or vacation rental, or nearby location, to save time and hassle on your weekend getaway or family vacation. Some hosts offer free delivery, while others set their own delivery fee.How do I get discounts when booking a car?Many Turo hosts offer discounted prices for weekly and monthly trips, as well as “early bird” discounts for trips booked a week or more in advance. Get the best deals and lowest rates possible on everything from cars to SUVs by booking longer trips, at least a week in advance.*On your Account page, make sure you’ve checked the box to receive email notifications, and enable push notifications from the Turo app in your phone settings — we’ll send you occasional promo codes, discounts, and deals!*See more about promotions & discounts* Any personal insurance you may have that covers damage to the host’s vehicle would kick in before your protection plan, except in limited situations for trips booked in Maryland, but this protects your own wallet. Liability insurance is provided under a policy issued to Turo by Travelers Excess and Surplus Lines Company. Terms, conditions, and exclusions apply. The policy does not provide coverage for damage to a host’s vehicle.For questions or information about the third party liability insurance for trips in the US, consumers in Maryland and the licensed states listed here may contact Turo Insurance Agency at (415) 508-0283 or claims@turo.agency. For questions about how damage to a host’s vehicle is handled, visit the Turo Support site.When a trip is booked in the state of Washington, physical damage to the host’s vehicle is covered by insurance purchased by Turo, but the Turo insurance does not change the contractual responsibilities of hosts or guests with respect to physical damage to a host’s vehicle.** Terms, conditions, and exclusions apply.*** Review the Guest Product Disclosure Statement for more information.TuroAboutTeamPoliciesCareersPressOpenRoadTuro shopLocationsUSA (EN)Australia (EN)Canada (EN)Canada (FR)France (FR)UK (EN)ExploreBook a carWeddingsTrust & safetyGet helpHostingList your carCarculatorAll-Star HostsHost toolsInsurance & protectionFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutubeBlogApp StoreGoogle PlayLanguage selectorEnglishEnglishEnglishEnglishEnglishFrançaisFrançaisVehicle typesCarsTrucksVansExotic & LuxuryConvertiblesSportClassicsMinivansSUVsElectric vehiclesMakesTeslaPorscheJeepBMWToyotaSubaruLamborghiniFerrariMercedes-BenzRolls-RoyceTop citiesAtlantaBostonCharlotteChicagoDenverFort LauderdaleHonoluluHoustonLas VegasLos AngelesJersey CityPhiladelphiaDallasJacksonvilleMiamiNew OrleansNew YorkOrlandoPhoenixSan AntonioSan DiegoSan FranciscoSeattleWashington DC©2024 TuroTermsPrivacySitemapCookie preferencesDo not sell or share my personal information
