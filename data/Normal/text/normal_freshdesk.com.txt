The reason why we moved to Freshworks was for the APIs so that we can be our own chat client. I really enjoyed the collaboration.Eric BompasProduct Manager, KlarnaWatch videoWhen a customer calls or emails or reaches out over social or Messenger, we can actually see what they've done and our people can refer to it. The customer feels as if we know them.Mirjam Van Den BergChief Customer Care Officer, TravixWatch videoFreshdesk has scaled with us. What I love most is that I don't need an administrator to maintain it.
