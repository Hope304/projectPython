His favorite thing to do as a traveler is to try local food he’s never eaten before. Stacey also enjoys exploring a new city on foot, ducking down shaded streets and unassuming alleys to find something unexpected. While airplanes make it much quicker to get there, once in a new spot, Stacey wants to explore by bike, car, or train to see it all up close and from ground level.
