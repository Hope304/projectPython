Editor-in-Chief: Gunther Eysenbach, MD, MPH, FACMI, Founding Editor and Publisher; Adjunct Professor, School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria (Canada) Impact Factor 7.4 The Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) is the pioneer open access eHealth journal and is the flagship journal of JMIR Publications. It is a leading health services and digital health journal globally in terms of quality/visibility (Journal Impact Factorâ„¢ 7.4 (Clarivate, 2023)) and is also the largest journal in the field. The journal is ranked #1 on Google Scholar in the 'Medical Informatics' discipline. The journal focuses on emerging technologies, medical devices, apps, engineering, telehealth and informatics applications for patient education, prevention, population health and clinical care. JMIR is indexed in all major literature indices including MEDLINE, PubMed/PMC, Scopus, Psycinfo, SCIE, JCR, EBSCO/EBSCO Essentials, DOAJ, GoOA and others. As a leading high-impact journal in its disciplines, ranking Q1 in both the 'Medical Informatics' and 'Health Care Sciences and Services' categories, it is a selective journal complemented by almost 30 specialty JMIR sister journals, which have a broader scope, and which together receive over 6.000 submissions a year. As an open access journal, we are read by clinicians, allied health professionals, informal caregivers, and patients alike, and have (as with all JMIR journals) a focus on readable and applied science reporting the design and evaluation of health innovations and emerging technologies. We publish original research, viewpoints, and reviews (both literature reviews and medical device/technology/app reviews). Peer-review reports are portable across JMIR journals and papers can be transferred, so authors save time by not having to resubmit a paper to a different journal but can simply transfer it between journals. We are also a leader in participatory and open science approaches, and offer the option to publish new submissions immediately as preprints, which receive DOIs for immediate citation (eg, in grant proposals), and for open peer-review purposes. We also invite patients to participate (eg, as peer-reviewers) and have patient representatives on editorial boards. As all JMIR journals, the journal encourages Open Science principles and strongly encourages publication of a protocol before data collection. Authors who have published a protocol in JMIR Research Protocols get a discount of 20% on the Article Processing Fee when publishing a subsequent results paper in any JMIR journal.

Those who connect AI with the world of science fiction may meet its growing rise with hesitancy or outright skepticism. However, AI is becoming increasingly pervasive in our society, from algorithms helping to sift through airline fares to substituting words in emails and SMS text messages based on user choices. Data collection is ongoing and is being leveraged by software platforms to analyze patterns and make predictions across multiple industries. Health care is gradually becoming part of this technological transformation, as advancements in computational power and storage converge with the rapid expansion of digitized medical information. Given the growing and inevitable integration of AI into health care systems, it is our viewpoint that pediatricians urgently require training and orientation to the uses, promises, and pitfalls of AI in medicine. AI is unlikely to solve the full array of complex challenges confronting pediatricians today; however, if used responsibly, it holds great potential to improve many aspects of care for providers, children, and families. Our aim in this viewpoint is to provide clinicians with a targeted introduction to the field of AI in pediatrics, including key promises, pitfalls, and clinical applications, so they can play a more active role in shaping the future impact of AI in medicine. 2024-02-29 | Skip recent articles and go to articles open for peer-review section Mobile Health (mhealth) Assessing the Effectiveness of STAPP@Work, a Self-Management Mobile App, in Reducing Work Stress and Preventing Burnout: Single-Case Experimental Design Study Work-related stress and burnout remain common problems among employees, leading to impaired health and higher absenteeism.

They have the potential to improve access to mental health interventions through automated, scalable, and personalized delivery of psychotherapeutic content. However, digital health interventions, including those delivered by CAs, often have high attrition rates. Identifying the factors associated with attrition is critical to improving future clinical trials. 2024-02-27 | Skip recent articles and go to articles open for peer-review section Viewpoints and Perspectives Improvement of Cancer Prevention and Control: Reflection on the Role of Emerging Information Technologies Cancer has become an important public health problem affecting the health of Chinese residents, as well as residents all over the world. With the improvement of cancer prevention and treatment, the growth of the mortality rate of cancers has slowed down gradually, but the incidence rate is still increasing rapidly, and cancers still impose heavy disease and economic burdens. Cancer screening and early cancer diagnosis and treatment are important ways to reduce the burden of cancer-related diseases. At present, various projects for early cancer diagnosis and treatment have been implemented in China. With the expansion of the coverage of these projects, the problems related to project implementation, operation, and management have emerged gradually. In recent years, emerging information technologies have been applied in the field of health and have facilitated health management and clinical decision-making. Meanwhile, China announced multiple policies to encourage and promote the application of information technologies in the field of health. Therefore, combined with the analysis of major problems in cancer prevention and control projects, this paper probes into how to apply information technologies such as biological information mining, artificial intelligence, and electronic information collection technology to various stages of cancer prevention and control. Information technologies realize the integrated management of prevention and control processes, for example, mobilization and preliminary identification, high-risk assessment, clinical screening, clinical diagnosis and treatment, tracking and follow-up, and biological sample management of high-risk groups, and promote the efficient implementation of cancer prevention and control projects in China. 2024-02-27 | Skip recent articles and go to articles open for peer-review section Clinical Informatics Integration of Patient-Reported Outcome Data Collected Via Web Applications and Mobile Apps Into a Nation-Wide COVID-19 Research Platform Using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources: Development Study The Network University Medicine projects are an important part of the German COVID-19 research infrastructure.
