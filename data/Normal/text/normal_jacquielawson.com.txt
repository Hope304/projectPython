Next on the agenda is the annual festival of sugary sentimentality that is Valentine’s Day. This year we’ve created a card starring a rather mischievous Cupid, which is well worth a watch! We’ve also taken the plunge and joined Instagram! If you’ve ever been curious about our card-making process then have a look at our page, on our @jacquielawsonecards, where we post behind-the-scenes snippets of this process – and you can also download free Jacquie Lawson phone wallpapers! Explore our new customisable birthday card! Follow us on Instagram to see how our cards come to life! Add a special something to your ecard with a digital gift card or digital gift!
