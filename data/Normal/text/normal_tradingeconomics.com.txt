The country also aims for an urban unemployment rate of around 5.5%, the creation of 12 million new urban jobs, and a CPI increase of around 3%. US Logistics Sector Rises the Most in 4 Months The Logistics Manager’s Index in the US increased to 56.5 in February 2024, the highest reading in four months, from 55.6 in January, amid a broad-based expansion in all metrics and continued progress in transportation and the buildup of inventories upstream at the manufacturing and wholesale levels. There was a continued rise in inventory levels (58.5 vs 52.8) which has led to a tightening in warehousing capacity (52.8 vs 54.1) and growth across all three transportation metrics. Particularly, transportation prices (57.6 vs 55.8) have reached their fastest rate of growth since the start of the freight recession in June 2022. Transportation capacity was also up (60.9 vs 54.5), bumping it higher than transportation prices and suggesting that we have not yet entered a true growth period in the freight market. Transportation utilization also increased (56.5 vs 55) and inventory costs slowed (62.9 vs 66.8). 32 min ago Eurozone Producer Price Deflation Cools in January Industrial producer prices in the Euro Area decreased by 8.6% year-on-year in January 2024, marking a moderation from a revised 10.7% drop recorded in the preceding month, though slightly higher than the anticipated 8.1% decline. Energy prices declined by 21.3%, slowing from a 27.3% decrease the previous month, while costs for intermediate goods went down by 5.8%, following a 4.8% fall. Meanwhile, inflation slowed for capital goods (2.1% vs 2.8%), durables (1.1% vs 2.9%), and non-durables (2.0% vs 3.3%). Excluding energy, producer prices dropped by 1.5%, accelerating from a 0.5% drop in the previous month. On a monthly basis, producer prices declined by 0.9%, surpassing market expectations of a 0.1% decrease. 89 min ago South Africa's Economy Dodges Recession in Q4 The South African economy rose by 0.1% in Q4 2023, compared to the previous quarter's 0.2% decline and below the expected 0.3% growth. Six out of ten industries contributed to this growth, with the transport sector contributing the most and expanding by 2.9%. Moreover, mining activity rebounded by 2.4% (vs -1% in Q3), while manufacturing saw a slight uptick of 0.2% (vs -1.1%), amidst fewer rotational power cuts. However, agriculture (-9.7%) and trade (-2.9%) experienced steep declines. On the expenditure side, household consumption rose by 0.2%, and changes in inventories contributed 1 percentage point. However, government spending fell 0.3% and fixed investment shrank 0.2%. Net exports contributed negatively by 1pp, following increases of 0,6% and 4,0% in exports and imports, respectively. Year-on-year, the GDP grew by 1.2% in Q4, following a 0.7% decrease in Q3 and above market estimates of a 0.9% rise. South Africa's economy grew by 0.6% in 2023, down from 1.9% the previous year. 2 hours ago Italy Private Sector Activity Expands at Marginal Pace The HCOB Italy Composite PMI increased to 51.1 in February 2024 from 50.7 in the previous month, marking the second positive reading after seven months of contractions in the country's private sector activity. The rebound was attributed to a sharper expansion in services activity (52.2 vs 51.2 in January), which offset a softer contraction in manufacturing (48.7 vs 48.5). Aggregate new business rose at a marginal pace due to the discrepancy between sectors regarding their output levels. Both service sector firms and factories added to their workforce. In the meantime, the price pressures lingered, driven mainly by an upturn in operating expenses for service sector companies. 3 hours ago Spain Private Sector Expands for 3rd Month and Faster The HCOB Spain Composite PMI surged to 53.9 in February 2024, a notable increase from January's 51.5, indicating the third successive month of expansion in the country's private sector and marking the strongest performance since May 2023. Spain's services sector activity grew at the fastest pace in nine months (PMI at 54.7 vs 52.1 in January) and manufacturing output rebounded (51.5 vs 49.2). New orders also increased the most in nine months. Job growth was observed across the private sector economy, while mild capacity pressures emerged as backlogs experienced a slight increase. Regarding prices, operating costs surged at the swiftest rate since April 2023, prompting companies to raise their prices to the greatest degree in a year. Finally, confidence in the future soared to its highest level in two years. 4 hours ago European Stocks Slightly Down Ahead of ECB, UK Budget European equity markets were slightly down on Tuesday, with both the STOXX 50 and broader STOXX 600 retreating 0.2%, as investors braced themselves for the upcoming ECB policy meeting scheduled for Thursday, which may dictate the trajectory of interest rate adjustments for the remainder of the year, and as anticipation surrounded the UK's impending budget announcement set for Wednesday. Meanwhile, China unveiled its economic growth target for 2024, aiming for a rate of approximately 5%, aligning with forecasts. In corporate news, Volkswagen's trucks arm Traton has forecast a 2024 return on sales in line with the previous year, and Thales reported an 11% underlying increase 2023 operating profit and 8% higher sales. In addition, Swiss chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli reported higher 2023 profit and British food-to-go retailer Greggs said annual profit rose 13%. 4 hours ago Commodity Forex Index Stock Bond Crypto Actual Chg %Chg Crude Oil 78.301 0.44 -0.56% Brent 82.501 0.30 -0.36% Natural gas 1.9083 0.01 -0.40% Gasoline 2.5654 0.02 -0.79% Heating Oil 2.6453 0.00 -0.07% Gold 2124.12 9.13 0.43% Silver 23.952 0.08 0.33% Copper 3.8498 0.00 -0.06% Soybeans 1143.75 3.25 -0.28% Wheat 559.66 4.34 -0.77% Coal 137.10 1.10 0.81% Steel 3685.00 16.00 -0.43% Iron Ore 116.00 1.50 -1.28% TTF Gas 28.05 1.17 4.33% Lumber 566.07 8.93 -1.55% More Actual Chg %Chg EURUSD 1.08497 0.0004 -0.04% GBPUSD 1.26777 0.0012 -0.10% AUDUSD 0.64911 0.0020 -0.31% NZDUSD 0.60787 0.0012 -0.20% USDJPY 150.429 0.0810 -0.05% USDCNY 7.21289 0.0041 0.06% USDCHF 0.88641 0.0017 0.19% USDCAD 1.35935 0.0023 0.17% USDMXN 16.9623 0.0023 0.01% USDINR 82.8860 0.0250 -0.03% USDBRL 4.95170 0.0059 0.12% USDRUB 90.9125 0.3055 -0.33% USDKRW 1334.50 3.6100 0.27% USDTRY 31.6494 0.0858 0.27% DXY 103.904 0.0720 0.07% More Actual Chg %Chg US500 5119.80 11 -0.22% US30 38938 52 -0.13% US100 18147 80 -0.44% JP225 40159 50 0.12% GB100 7641 0 0.00% DE40 17708 8 -0.05% FR40 7959 2 0.03% IT40 33029 116 0.35% ES35 10061 9 -0.09% AU200 7740 4 0.05% SHANGHAI 3048 8 0.28% SENSEX 73677 195 -0.26% CATSX 21531 21 -0.10% MOEX 3301 4 0.13% IBOVESPA 128341 840 -0.65% More Actual Chg %Chg Apple 175.10 4.56 -2.54% Tesla 188.14 14.50 -7.16% Microsoft 414.92 0.58 -0.14% Amazon 177.58 0.64 -0.36% Meta 498.19 4.11 -0.82% Nvidia 852.37 29.58 3.60% Visa 280.53 2.63 -0.93% JPMorgan 186.68 1.39 0.75% Intel 45.61 1.79 4.08% J&J 159.84 2.28 -1.41% P&G 159.56 0.71 0.45% Exxon Mobil 104.36 1.48 -1.40% 3M 91.44 0.42 -0.46% Goldman Sachs 392.25 4.15 1.07% Caterpillar 338.65 1.95 0.58% More Actual Chg %Chg United States 4.1857 0.033 -0.03% United Kingdom 4.0530 0.071 -0.07% Japan 0.7040 0.009 -0.01% Australia 4.0810 0.034 -0.03% Germany 2.3670 0.030 -0.03% Brazil 10.7050 0.035 -0.04% Russia 13.0600 0.040 0.04% India 7.0570 0.003 0.00% Canada 3.4190 0.031 -0.03% Italy 3.7350 0.088 -0.09% France 2.8290 0.044 -0.04% South Africa 10.1100 0.020 -0.02% China 2.3390 0.023 -0.02% Switzerland 0.7820 0.021 -0.02% Chile 5.6700 0.000 0.00% More Actual Chg %Chg Bitcoin 66855 641 -0.95% Ether 3752.00 166.1000 4.63% Binance 419.0 0.9000 0.22% Cardano 0.77303 0.0037 0.48% Solana 131.7477 0.8823 -0.67% Ripple 0.65057 0.0006 -0.10% Polkadot 10.51 0.6282 6.35% Avalanche 43.01 0.1990 0.46% Polygon 1.14 0.0088 -0.77% Cosmos 12.74 0.3206 2.58% Dai 0.99829 0.0014 -0.14% Litecoin 89.750 1.2400 1.40% Uniswap 13.19 0.8086 6.53% Algorand 0.25 0.0053 2.14% Bitcoin Cash 446.13 17.4400 -3.76% More Calendar 01:00 PM Brazil S&P Global Services PMI 02:45 PM US S&P Global Services PMI Final 02:45 PM US S&P Global Composite PMI Final 03:00 PM US ISM Services PMI 03:00 PM US Factory Orders MoM Country GDP GDP Growth Interest Rate Inflation Rate Jobless Rate Gov.
