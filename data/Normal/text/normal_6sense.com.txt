Reduce go-to-market waste. 6sense Revenue AI™ drives predictable revenue growth by uncovering anonymous buyers, understanding their behavior, and directing you to engage the ones most likely to buy. Explore Platform Buyers don’t care about your quota B2B buying teams aren’t big fans of marketers and sellers. Less than 3% of them engage with vendors early in the buying journey. Instead, they conduct online research in stealth mode. That makes it a lot harder for your team to find and close deals.But there’s a twist: Buyers create digital “breadcrumb trails” of buying signals as they research. This crucial, unseen data hides in what we call the Dark Funnel™. Traditional martech systems can’t interpret it. 6sense can.
