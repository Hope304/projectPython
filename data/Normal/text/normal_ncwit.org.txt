NCWIT is a thriving community, leveraging an ecosystem of programs and initiatives. Powered by the latest social science research, this community works to increase the meaningful and influential participation of all girls and women in computing—at the intersections of race/ethnicity, class, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, and other historically marginalized identities—from K-12 through career. K-12 Higher Ed Workforce Inclusion changes what's possible. Individuals from diverse backgrounds must be able to access creative technical roles and meaningfully contribute to innovation. Only then will the technical products and services of the future be representative of the populations they serve. K-12 Change Leaders Start Here LEARN MORE Higher Ed Change Leaders Start Here LEARN MORE Workforce Change Leaders Start Here LEARN MORE “NCWIT is why I chose to stay in engineering. The NCWIT Community became my second new family. The resources and information that NCWIT provides to young women throughout the most formative years of their lives have impacted so many. I am so proud to represent the programs that built me.” LEARN MORE “Changing culture takes significant time and effort. Organizations need someone that has expertise and experience in this area, and NCWIT is well-equipped to guide organizations on what’s necessary and how to do it.” Tim Reid, IT Director, Qualcomm Incorporated LEARN MORE “I believe we owe much of our success in the last decade to our work with NCWIT. Since 2008, the number of women declaring computing as their majors has increased more than eight-fold.” Laura Dillon, Professor Emeritus Computer Science & Engineering Michigan State University LEARN MORE We all stand to benefit from changing or expanding existing norms that are rooted in overlapping systems of bias. Groups with greater diversity solve complex problems better and faster than homogenous groups. Culture isn't something you have, it's something you do. Counselors for Computing (C4C) is the only professional development program for school counselors in the U.S. focused entirely on computing and inclusion. C4C has trained more than 15,000 school counselors with a potential to reach more than 7 million students. LEARN MORE Tech Inclusion Journey The Tech Inclusion Journey™ empowers computing organizations to implement and sustain inclusive, equitable cultures. Initial findings reveal that 88 percent of participants report an improvement in their ability to create a more inclusive work environment. LEARN MORE Aspirations in Computing 91 percent of existing Aspirations in Computing Community members report a college major or minor in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) field. LEARN MORE Sit with me And have a conversation for change Sit With Me invites everyone to validate and recognize the important role women play in creating future technology by taking a small but symbolic action: sit in a red chair and share your story. LEARN MORE Girls who have the combined support of parents and teachers are three times more likely to study computer science than girls who don’t have that support. Only 5% of CTOs in the top 1,000 U.S. companies (by revenue) are women.
