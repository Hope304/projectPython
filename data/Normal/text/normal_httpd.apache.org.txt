Sponsorship The Number One HTTP Server On The Internet¶ The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards. The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") was launched in 1995 and it has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996. It has celebrated its 25th birthday as a project in February 2020. The Apache HTTP Server is a project of The Apache Software Foundation. Apache httpd 2.4.58 Released 2023-10-19¶ The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are pleased to announce the release of version 2.4.58 of the Apache HTTP Server ("httpd"). This latest release from the 2.4.x stable branch represents the best available version of Apache HTTP Server. Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.43 or newer is required in order to operate a TLS 1.3 web server with OpenSSL 1.1.1.
