The goals of this project include: (1) Raising awareness of the issue of DNS Privacy (2) Empowering users to take advantage of DNS Privacy tools and resources (client applications, DNS Privacy resolvers) (3) Evolving the DNS to support DNS Privacy and in particular developing new DNS Protocol standards (4) Working towards full support for DNS Privacy in a range of Open Source DNS implementations including: getdns, Unbound, NSD, BIND, PowerDNS and Knot (Auth and Resolver) (5) Co-ordinating deployment of DNS Privacy services and documenting operational practices Among the many contributors to this project are Sinodun IT, NLnet Labs, SalesForce, Surftnet, NLnet Foundation, OTF, Stephane Bortzmeyer and No Mountain Software. Ongoing DNS Privacy work Nov 2023 IETF ADD WG publishes 3 new RFC’s: RFC 9461: Service Binding Mapping for DNS Servers RFC 9462: Discovery of Designated Resolvers RFC 9463: DHCP and Router Advertisement Options for the Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) Mullvad’s public encrypted DNS Servers run in RAM now Oct 2023 IETF DPRIVE WG: Unilateral Opportunistic Deployment of Encrypted Recursive-to-Authoritative DNS approved for publication Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) support for Windows Insiders Cloudflare announces initial ECH support Encrypted Client Hello support in browsers: Chrome-1, Chrome-2 Firefox Sept 2023 Knot Authoritative 3.3.0 includes DNS-over-QUIC and XFR-over-QUIC OARC 41: Implementing EDNS Client Subnet in a privacy preserving way by Andrey Meshkov of AdGuard Encrypted DNS in the Network of Deutsche Telekom: Status and Outlook See all previous DNS work Overview of DNS Privacy Status High level overview of ongoing work on DNS Privacy with monthly updates IETF Working Groups Catch up with the latest standards being developed to support DNS Privacy in the DPRIVE Working group. Work on adaptive discovery mechanisms for DNS is happening in the ADD Working Group Encrypted DNS Deployment Initiative (EDDI) Catch up with the latest work done by the Encrypted DNS Deployment Initiative, a community effort to ensure the the smooth global adoption and reliable operation at scale of DNS encryption technology.
