But it can be reduced in an economically rational and responsible way. Cybersecurity isn't one-size-fits-all. Your cybersecurity partners should understand your business and deliver security outcomes that matter to you. Exposure can be reduced. Proactive identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities decreases likelihood of successful attacks. More investment isn't always the answer. Security outcomes often can be improved by optimizing current cyber investments. Cyber attacks are inevitable. But you can minimize the likelihood of success and mitigate potential impact through preparation, rapid detection, and effective response capabilities. Cybersecurity is a team sport. Most organizations will never have enough resources to stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape. 25+ years of industry-recognized intelligence enriching outcomes across our portfolio Billions of threat intelligence records 200k+ hours of pen tests annually 40k vulnerabilities discovered annually "Trustwave gave us greater ability to see a threat from end to end, where it originated from, where it went, what systems it affected, to identify the advanced vectors more quickly and contain the threat." Jason Cowie CIO, Curtin UniversityRead the Case Study "The expertise found in Trustwave people was the key difference between other SOC services in the market. We knew that having access to cyber specialists who had a wealth of experience within all of our key existing technologies was a massive advantage." Revasan Govender Head of IT, Higgins CoatingsRead the Case Study "The workshops went beyond a basic tabletop exercise and were very well received and effective. He credits this success to the fact that Trustwave tailored the curriculum to the exact situation desired by the MoD, noting that if the company had based the lesson on a more generic target, say the healthcare sector, those attending might not have bought into the experience."
