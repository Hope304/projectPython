Add To My AlzForum 05 Mar 2024 In snoozing mice, silencing neurons dampened ion waves in the interstitial fluid and slowed the flow of solutes. Activating neurons powered CSF flow through the brain. More on Moribund Mitochondrial Respiration Prior to Plaques Add To My AlzForum 3 comments 05 Mar 2024 Mitochondrial activation waned in brain cells a year before mice developed plaques. Inhibiting the kinase GSK3β partially restored the organelles. Tau Fragments in Plasma Track with Tangles, Cognitive Decline Add To My AlzForum 4 comments 01 Mar 2024 A new immunoassay detects N-terminal fragments of tau. They predict tangle accumulation, cortical atrophy, and cognitive decline. Different Cellular Mechanisms in Familial and Sporadic Alzheimer’s? Add To My AlzForum 1 comment 29 Feb 2024 A single-nuclei RNA-Seq study found more autophagy and chaperone gene expression in familial AD brain, more intense microglial activation in sporadic. From St. Louis to Beijing: AD Biomarkers Change Similarly Before Symptoms Add To My AlzForum 2 comments 29 Feb 2024 Using different methods and studying different populations, two studies report similar trajectories of fluid and imaging biomarkers over a 20-year span of AD. No Loitering: Pathogenic Liaisons Trap TDP-43 in the Cytoplasm Add To My AlzForum 29 Feb 2024 Methylated CAG-repeat RNAs and 14-3-3θ promote TDP-43 aggregation. While a Fly Sleeps, Its Glia Burn Neuronal Lipids to Refresh the Brain Add To My AlzForum 4 comments 27 Feb 2024 In awake fruit flies, neurons pass toxic lipids to glia for storage. When the flies sleep, glia metabolize the fat to reset for a new day. Large Proteomic Study Flags Blood Biomarkers That Could Foretell Dementia Add To My AlzForum 23 Feb 2024 In more than 52,000 cognitively healthy people, elevated plasma GFAP or NfL more than doubled the risk the person would develop dementia over the next 14 years. View All News SPOTLIGHT Do Sleep Rhythms Create Ion Waves That Rinse the Brain? How does the brain cleanse itself? Its neurons get the credit in two new studies. During sleep, they report, synchronized neuronal firing generates waves of ions that may power the flow of interstitial fluid through the parenchyma, washing waste from the brain. Silencing neurons slowed solute outflow, activating neurons enhanced it. The papers inject a new mechanism into the debate about glymphatic clearance. Plasma NTA-tau Tracks Tangles, Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer’s N-terminal tau fragments, dubbed NTA-tau, could be plasma markers of tangles in the brain. People with plaques and tangles had twice as much plasma NTA-tau as did people with neither. Tangles drove this link. High baseline NTA-tau predicted more tangles, cortical atrophy, and cognitive decline over six years. Plasma NTA-tau might be useful as a clinical trial screening tool to flag people likely to progress quickly, and as an outcome measure to track changes in tangles.
