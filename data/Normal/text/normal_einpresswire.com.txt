Call: +1 (202) 335-3939 Client Testimonials See All You are by far the best and most efficient press release distribution service we have ever used. And this includes PR Newswire and Business Wire. With your company, our PR was distributed to more media entities than we have ever had before. For $99 per PR, you give us what we would have to pay $2,000 through PR Newswire and all the rest. This is the best-kept secret in the public relations business. Thanks again for all the good work you do. — Jennifer Gray, Celebrity News PR A prompt and competitive press release distribution service. The interface is intuitive and easy to use. The scheduled press releases are always on time, even on short notice. As it should be. — Aicue LLC EIN Presswire is easy to use, effective, with a big reach, at a fraction of the cost of other news release distributors. I love it. They have also allowed us to issue news releases on important topics, like animal agriculture's enormous role in climate change, that other news services have rejected, perhaps for fear of offending their big corporate clients. EIN Presswire is the real deal. — Jane Velez-Mitchell, Managing Editor, JaneUnChained.com I love the fact that EIN Presswire doesn’t nickel and dime with extra charges. You get a lot of extra bells and whistles as part of the base fee. What I also like is the speed with which it posts the released typically within minutes. Great service. — Hackney Communications Follow @EINPresswire Why Us Testimonials - Client Reviews Blog posts Video Tutorials Browse All Releases Browse Featured Release Browse by Topic Browse by Country Browse by U.S. State Browse by Date Free Press Release Distribution Press Release Distribution Services Send Press Release Submit Free Press Release Press Release Distribution Media Monitoring Distribution Overview World Media Directory U.S. TV-Radio Microwires Newsdesk NewsPlugin PR Distribution How It Works Why Us Pricing Distribution Editorial Guidelines Submit Release Newswires All Newswires World Newswires US Newswires Industry Newswires Press Releases All Press Releases Releases by Country Releases by US State Releases by Industry Releases by Date Resources World Media Directory Mobile App Affiliate Program RSS Feeds Email Newsletters AI Press Release Generator News Alert Maker NewsPlugin Help/Support FAQ Video Tutorials Client Testimonials About About EIN Presswire Newsroom Investor Inquiries Career Opportunities Contact Follow EIN Presswire User Agreement Privacy Policy Copyright Policy © 1995-2024 Newsmatics Inc. dba EIN Presswire All Right Reserved.
