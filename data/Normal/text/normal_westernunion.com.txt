It is easy, quick and I get everything done. Since I am sending money to support my wife d…oing business overseas this avails me of the answer to help her. It is a startup so it is not big enough yet to have the better money accounting afforded yet. Western Union saved my information so that it is even faster but there are still security items they use to verify so it is safe. Since this application everything flows nicely and I suggest you give it a try!Read full review Read less Very convenient and the price is great…29/01/2020I used to go to a certain store where I had to wait in line and the charge for the transaction was way more expensive.
