The main goal of the display is to draw attention to sustainable, accessible, and equitable futures while highlighting the value of alternative responses to resource constraints. As the event draws to a close, ArchDaily explores 10 architectural installations that respond to the overarching theme through various mediums.Curated by Tosin Oshinowo under the theme “The beauty of Impermanence: An Architecture of Adaptability,” the triennial has contributions from 29 architects and studios across 25 countries. From 51-1 Arquitectos transforming an unapproachable place into a dynamic play space featuring popular board games from various regions to Al Borde redefining a space with a custom-designed shading structure made with natural materials, the Sharjah Architecture Triennial presents a diverse array of architectural interventions. WaiWai's showcase spotlights three instances of modern architecture in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, highlighting their significant evolution. DAAR's "Concrete Tent" combines elements of a mobile tent and concrete house, exploring the concept of "permanent temporariness.” These installations offer innovative perspectives on adaptability, sustainability, and cultural significance within the architectural landscape.+ 7https://www.archdaily.com/1014059/highlights-from-the-sharjah-triennial-10-installations-exploring-the-beauty-of-impermanenceNour FakharanySaveRead more » How Landscape Architects are Taking on Embodied CarbonMarch 05 Videos Sketch of Bonnet Springs Park / Sasaki. Image © Sasaki“Landscape architects have started conversations about embodied carbon. There is a realization that we can no longer ignore the grey parts,” said Stephanie Carlisle, Senior Researcher, Carbon Leadership Forum and the University of Washington, during the first in a series of webinars organized by the ASLA Biodiversity and Climate Action Committee.The grey parts are concrete, steel, and other manufactured products in projects. And the conversations happening are laying the foundation for a shift away from using these materials. The landscape architect climate leaders driving these conversations are offering practical ways to decarbonize projects and specify low-carbon materials.+ 1https://www.archdaily.com/1014041/how-landscape-architects-are-taking-on-embodied-carbonJared GreenSaveRead more » FG House / Caracho ArquitetosMarch 05© Daniel Santo+ 19 Houses•Bauru, Brazil Architects: Caracho Arquitetos Area Area of this architecture project Area: 6308 ft² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2023 Manufacturers Brands with products used in this architecture project Manufacturers: Deca, Docol, Elettromec, Tramontina, kitchenshttps://www.archdaily.com/1014003/fg-house-caracho-arquitetosPilar CaballeroSaveRead more » Fendi Factory / PiuarchMarch 05© Andrea Ferrari+ 3 Factory, Offices•Bagno a Ripoli, Italy Architects: Piuarch Area Area of this architecture project Area: 14000 m² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2022 https://www.archdaily.com/994593/fendi-factory-piuarchHana AbdelSaveRead more » Crafting Atmospheres: Sensory, Textured Lighting in Architectural DesignMarch 05 | Sponsored ContentCortesia de VibiaFlat and polished surfaces tend to evoke feelings of coldness and sterility, while raw, natural materials can create a sense of warmth and connection. Textures can trigger memories and emotions, connecting us to past experiences and the sense of touch. In the seminal book "The Eyes of the Skin", Juhani Pallasmaa emphasizes the importance of sensory perception in architecture and objects beyond sight, particularly the role of touch and texture in shaping our experience. According to Pallasmaa, contemporary culture, influenced by technology and visual media, has overemphasized the visual aspect of spaces, neglecting other senses, especially touch, which is vital for understanding and appreciating the surrounding environment.https://www.archdaily.com/1005110/crafting-atmospheres-sensory-textured-lighting-in-architectural-designEduardo SouzaSaveRead more » Upper House / Koichi Takada ArchitectsMarch 05© Scott Burrows Photographer+ 14 Apartments, Residential•South Brisbane, Australia Architects: Koichi Takada Architects Area Area of this architecture project Area: 19700 m² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2023 Manufacturers Brands with products used in this architecture project Manufacturers: Gaggenau, Miele, Big Ass Fan, Dulux, Fisher and Paykel, +4Hafele, Lee Broom, Rogerseller, Zetr-4https://www.archdaily.com/1014091/upper-house-koichi-takada-architectsHana AbdelSaveRead more » Jinan Huizhong Starry Center / THAD SUP AtelierMarch 05© Zhi Xia+ 36 Commercial Architecture, Buildings•Jinan, China Architects: THAD SUP Atelier Area Area of this architecture project Area: 27635 m² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2022 https://www.archdaily.com/1013702/jinan-huizhong-starry-center-thad-sup-atelierPilar CaballeroSaveRead more » Casa á Beiramar / Metropole ArchitectsMarch 05 Videos © Grant Pitcher+ 27 Houses•Simbithi Eco Estate, South Africa Architects: Metropole Architects Area Area of this architecture project Area: 750 m² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2023 Manufacturers Brands with products used in this architecture project Manufacturers: Afrigran, Arkivio, Roche Bobois, Timber Trendshttps://www.archdaily.com/1014081/casa-a-beiramar-metropole-architectsHana AbdelSaveRead more » INSIDE Guangzhou Gin Bar & Coffee Shop / R-BASMarch 04© ZCStudio+ 16 Restaurant & Bar Interiors•Guangzhou, China Architects: R-BAS Area Area of this architecture project Area: 37 m² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2021 https://www.archdaily.com/1013963/inside-guangzhou-r-basAndreas LucoSaveRead more » Tree House / Entre Nos AtelierMarch 04© Ingrid Johanning+ 21 Houses•San Mateo, Costa Rica Architects: Entre Nos Atelier Area Area of this architecture project Area: 110 m² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2023 https://www.archdaily.com/1013627/tree-house-entre-nos-atelierValeria SilvaSaveRead more » Pebble Beach / Feldman ArchitectureMarch 04© David Tsay+ 16 Houses, Renovation•Del Monte Forest, United States Architects: Feldman Architecture Area Area of this architecture project Area: 3150 ft² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2023 Manufacturers Brands with products used in this architecture project Manufacturers: Sherwin-Williams, Benjamin Moore, Brizo, Cesarstone, Concrete Collaborative, +3Design Within Reach, Kolbe, Sean Woolsey-3 Professionals: Raili CA Design, Seven Springs Studio, McNickle Construction https://www.archdaily.com/1014005/pebble-beach-feldman-architecturePilar CaballeroSaveRead more » PAR House / ARCHITECTS OFFICEMarch 04© Felco+ 30 Houses•Monte Mor, Brazil Architects: ARCHITECTS OFFICE Area Area of this architecture project Area: 574 m² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2023 Manufacturers Brands with products used in this architecture project Manufacturers: Concept Store, Estudio Rain, Pair Homehttps://www.archdaily.com/1014050/par-house-architects-officePilar CaballeroSaveRead more » MẮM Restaurant / Sawadeesign StudioMarch 04© Quang Tran+ 41 Restaurant•Nha Trang, Vietnam Architects: Sawadeesign Studio Area Area of this architecture project Area: 350 m² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2024 Manufacturers Brands with products used in this architecture project Manufacturers: Saint-Gobain, Dulux, HOA PHAT GROUP, Phillips, TUYNEL DONG NAI, +2Thanh Hoa Stone, Vietbeton-2https://www.archdaily.com/1014000/mam-restaurant-sawadeesign-studioHana AbdelSaveRead more » Arab Designers Crafting their Own Narrative: Design Doha 2024 Explores Identity and InnovationMarch 04Reverie- Hiba Shahzada.

Facilitating dialogues between designers, the event challenges the misconception that the Arab world is composed of a singular culture. It highlights, therefore, the diversity of populations, landscapes, and histories it encompasses.Centered on "Arab Design Now," a regional survey showcasing the works of over 70 Arab designers, featuring 38 commissioned pieces, Design Doha is running from February 24 to August 5, 2024. ArchDaily had the opportunity to talk to Rana Beiruti, curator of the main exhibition, during the event's opening, to grasp the significance of the biennial and delve into some of the key installations, exploring the stories behind these interventions, learning about the designers involved, and gaining insights into their creative processes.+ 12https://www.archdaily.com/1013926/arab-designers-crafting-their-own-narrative-design-doha-2024-explores-identity-and-innovationChristele HarroukSaveRead more » Realengo Park Market Square / Ayako Arquitetura + Helena Meirelles arquitetura + Larissa Monteiro + messina | rivas + Zebulun ArquiteturaMarch 04© Federico Cairoli+ 15 Public Space•Realengo, Brazil Architects: Ayako Arquitetura, Helena Meirelles arquitetura, Larissa Monteiro, Zebulun Arquitetura, messina | rivas Area Area of this architecture project Area: 790 m² Year Completion year of this architecture project Year: 2023 https://www.archdaily.com/1014009/realengo-park-market-square-ayako-arquitetura-plus-helena-meirelles-arquitetura-plus-larissa-monteiro-plus-messina-rivas-plus-zebulun-arquiteturaValeria SilvaSaveRead more » “AI Is Redefining Construction and Professionals Need to Lead the Change” Says BIG Design Technology ManagerMarch 04 | Sponsored ContentLeonardo.ai. AI-generated image by. Image © ZIGURAT Institute of Technology“We’re on the verge of one of the biggest revolutions that we’re going to face in the industry,” warns German Otto Bodenbender, Design Technology Manager at BIG Barcelona and Professor of ZIGURAT Institute of Technology. First, it was the CAD revolution, with the introduction of computers; then it was the turn of BIM methodology, with new processes and workflows; and now, when many professionals haven’t yet gotten used to all those changes, we have AI. This is not just affecting how we do things, but is revolutionizing the entire lifespan of construction processes, introducing new computational capacities in every single aspect of architecture, construction, and engineering. https://www.archdaily.com/1013568/ai-is-redefining-construction-and-professionals-need-to-lead-the-change-says-big-design-technology-managerRene SubmissionsSaveRead more » The 10th Edition of Toronto's Winter Stations Reveals Images of the Winning ProjectsMarch 04We Caught A UFO! by Xavier Madden and Katja Banovic, Croatia and Australia. Image Courtesy of Winter StationsWinter Stations, now in its 10th year, has unveiled the winning designs selected from a pool of hundreds of submissions worldwide. Following an international design competition launched in November 2023, designers, artists, and architects contributed with bold proposals to reimagine the lifeguard stations along Toronto’s east-end beaches for the winter. Launched by RAW Design, Ferris + Associates, and Curio in 2014, the event aims to gather an international design and art community to join in this playful exercise of rethinking public spaces through bold temporary interventions. The winning designs were realized with the support of Anex Works, a Toronto-based fabrication group, and will be on display until the end of March.For its 10th anniversary edition, the chosen theme for this year is “Resonance,” hoping to challenge designers to reflect on the artistic legacy and enduring impact of the Winter Stations and to embark on a journey of reinvention and reimagination. The projects were invited to recreate and reinvent installations from previous Winer Stations editions, offering moments of contemplation and remembrance. The event also continues the tradition of the Lifeguard Sands, inviting designers to incorporate them into their designs without structurally altering the stands in any manner.+ 14https://www.archdaily.com/1012269/the-10th-edition-of-torontos-winter-stations-announces-winning-projectsMaria-Cristina FlorianSaveRead more » Balbin 4289 Ricci Flats / A3 Luppi Ugalde WinterMarch 04© Javier Agustín Rojas+ 25 •Buenos Aires, Argentina Architects: A3 Luppi Ugalde Winter Area Area of this architecture project Area: 1900 m² Manufacturers Brands with products used in this architecture project Manufacturers: Caros Divisores, New Light, Poralhttps://www.archdaily.com/1014001/balbin-4289-ricci-flats-a3-luppi-ugalde-winterAndreas LucoSaveRead more » Discover more ✖You've started following your first account!Did you know?You'll now receive updates based on what you follow!
