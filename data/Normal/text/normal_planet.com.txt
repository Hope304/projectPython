Knowing the actual level of production in Ukraine contributes to lowered uncertainty and price volatility in food markets.”Dr. Becker-ReshefProgram Director for NASA Harvest“Our goals are to support our farmers, helping them raise happy cows and continuously improve their farm ecosystems, and with Planet’s highly accessible satellite datasets, we have been able to advance these goals.”Jessica LuhningSenior Sustainability Manager, Organic Valley“We are perpetually asking ourselves, does the environment support wildfire growth, and if it does, how are we going to operate differently? Planet provides the high-resolution data necessary to help us answer that question on a daily basis.”Chris ArendsMeteorology Program Manager, San Diego Gas & Electric.“At a time when communications blackouts are increasingly common, satellite imagery cuts through the fog of war to show us conflict's victims — civilians. High revisit satellite imagery does not merely show the before and after, but can describe the direction a situation is going in. Civilians suffer the most in war and satellite imagery is increasingly able to produce visual evidence of that suffering.”Alexander LeeDirector and Lead Investigator, Vigil Monitor.“A picture tells a thousand words. Before we used Planet, we only had access to yearly imagery. We were able to use Planet imagery to determine that illegal dumping of asbestos was occurring on a property, a site that's empty, and then the next day, it's got dumping on it. That now you see it, now you don't is something that Planet provides us.”Sue ReaDPIE, Government of NSW“Planet data gives us a real opportunity for understanding how the world's environment is changing in response to a whole range of drivers. The quality of the Planet data particularly the SkySat is just superb. The nice thing about SkySat is actually we can task parts of the landscape and say, "I want to have the picture of this at this time."”Prof. Richard LucasLiving Wales“Without Planet, we wouldn't have half the knowledge we do on the landscape in Wales. It's a very effective tool allowing us to do our job really well. It provides us with a new capacity to understand what's going on, when it's happening, how it's happening and what we can do about it.”Prof. Richard LucasLiving WalesOur Daily PlanetEvery day, people around the world are using Planet data to reveal the changes happening in the areas they care about most.Take me to the GalleryProductsPlanet MonitoringPlanet BasemapsPlanet TaskingPlanetary VariablesPlanet HyperspectralPlanet Analytic FeedsPlanet PlatformProfessional ServicesSolutionsAgricultureCivil GovernmentDefense & IntelligenceDrought ResponseScience ProgramsEnergy & InfrastructureFinance & InsuranceForestry & Land UseMappingMaritimeSustainabilityPlanet FederalNonprofit ProgramInvestorsPartnersConnect with Planet PartnersBecome a PartnerPlanet Esri PartnershipCertification ProgramFind a PartnerCompanyAbout UsCustomer StoriesOur TeamCareersPressResourcesESG at PlanetContact UsArt at PlanetFAQsSupportPlanet CommunityPlanet UniversityDeveloper CenterHelp CenterQuick LinksContact SalesExplorer Log InPartner PortalInvestorsBlogGalleryDisaster DataPublicationsPlanet InsightsPlanet Stories© 2024 Planet Labs PBC.
