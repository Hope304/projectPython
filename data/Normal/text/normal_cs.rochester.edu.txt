He spoke about his work developing the SAPIEN Coach, an interactive, multilingual, emotionally-responsive, virtual-human-based coaching platform for learning academic or soft skills.Read about Masum's workVeteran pursues CS degreeComputer Science major Garrett Boehmer ’25, is one of 41 veterans enrolled across all University campuses.Many times during his service in the US Army, Garrett was within walking distance of the North Korean border. His journey to Rochester has taken 12 years and includes four schools and three majors.“There have been so many unexpected events,” says Garrett, who transferred to the University from nearby Monroe Community College last January through Rochester’s “2+2” partnership with the college. “But I always knew that someday I would get my college degree.” Read about Garrett's PathHuman brain’s ‘temporal scaffolding’ inspires new AI approachesAssociate Professor Christopher Kanan is part of a transdisciplinary team using a recent hypothesis about how the human brain uses sleep and awake periods to learn over time to try to overcome artificial intelligence’s limitations with lifelong learningRead about AI scaffoldingCS study shows media bias is growingA team from the Department of Computer Science used machine learning to analyze publications across the political spectrum.Read about AI biasChris Kanan to optimize nuclear fusion with generative AIThe US Department of Energy has granted almost $3M to a joint venture between the CS Department and The Laboratory for Laser Energetics in an effort to use AI to improve inertial fusion energy generation.Read about fusion generationLeveraging Computing and Cognition to Tackle Climate ChangeComputer Science PhD student Adiba Proma seeks to help people reduce their carbon footprint with computer design principles.Read about Adiba's researchWant more information about the Department of Computer Science?
