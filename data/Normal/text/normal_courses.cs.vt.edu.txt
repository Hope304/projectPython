The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that students have at least one course that synthesizes and integrates skills and knowledge acquired throughout the CS undergraduate curriculum, and which includes a significant design experience, where teamwork and written and oral communication are a key part of that design experience. Characteristics of a Capstone Course Although the various 4000 level courses designated as capstone courses focus on different problem domains and may be organized differently, all capstone courses are distinguished by the following characteristics: Requires synthesis and integration of knowledge and skills acquired across the curriculum to solve a significant open-ended problem. Provides a significant design experience in developing a solution, including the examination of multiple design alternatives, with justification for the final path taken. Uses teamwork. Requires significant written, oral and visual deliverables, including a summative report and presentation. Includes multiple reflection activities, perhaps repeated periodically, e.g., individual reflective writing assignments, design or code reviews, group or individual peer reviews. Includes an evaluation or assessment activity to gauge the merit the solution. Approved CS Capstone Courses CS 4284: Systems & Networking Capstone CS 4274: Secure Computing Capstone CS 4414: Issues in Scientific Computing (when taught by CS faculty) CS 4624: Multimedia, Hypertext & Information Access CS 4634: Design of Information CS 4644: Creative Computing Studio CS 4664: Data-Centric Computing Capstone CS 4704: Software Engineering Capstone CS 4784: Human-Computer Interaction Capstone CS 4884: Computational Biology & Bioinformatics Capstone In addition, individual CS 4994 Undergraduate Research projects where the supervising faculty member ensures the characteristics of a capstone course listed above are present (including working on a team, examining multiple design alternatives, providing significant written, oral and visual deliverables, evaluating or assessing merit of the solution, etc.) may be counted for capstone credit with prior approval from the Associate Department Head. For such CS 4994 projects, the supervising faculty member should include a request for capstone credit with an explanation of how capstone characteristics are achieved in the project proposal. Technical Electives Any Computer Science 3/4/5000-level course that is not otherwise used to fulfill a Computer Science requirement can be used as a technical elective. Examples of non-CS courses that have been accepted as technical electives are below. Important: The inclusion of a course on this list does not guarantee access to the course for Computer Science majors. Some of these courses may be restricted by major, and instructor's permission would be needed to take the course. Others have prerequisites that must be met to be eligible to take the course.

For consideration, the course must have significant technical content relevant to the science or application of computing. Note: This includes non-CS Independent Study (4974) and Undergraduate Research (4994) courses. Special Study (4984) courses from outside the Computer Science Department may be approved, but only if the request is submitted for review before the start of the course. For any new course approved as a technical elective, students will have to submit a course substitution request to ensure the credit is applied appropriately. Please submit this form once you have completed the course.
