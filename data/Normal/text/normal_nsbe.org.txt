NSBE is Black History. Our History Lives! The African American engineering students who came to Purdue University were small in number in the early 1970s, but they came with big dreams. It was a time of tangible progress for Blacks in politics, educational attainment and, to a lesser extent, business in the U.S., but it was also a time of frustration, especially among Black youth, about the injustice and socioeconomic inequity that continued to afflict African American communities after the gains made by the Civil Rights Movement.Read Article 50k and CountingToday, the 50k Coalition’s ambitious goal has been met. The group’s 2023 Impact Report, presented at a symposium on Feb. 19, announced that more than 51,000 women or BIPOC candidates received engineering degrees in 2020, five years earlier than anticipated.Read Article Celebrating Black History MonthThis Black History Month, we are thrilled to bring back #BlackExcellenceinSTEM to acknowledge and commend the remarkable accomplishments of our members and affiliates in the STEM field!

The damage caused by this ruling will be deep and far-reaching, without question: boosting the growth of barriers to higher education that Black and other BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) communities have faced for centuries, perpetuating racial and ethnic ignorance among students on predominantly white college and university campuses and increasing the destructive polarization now consuming this nation. We have advanced only to once again be forced backward.
