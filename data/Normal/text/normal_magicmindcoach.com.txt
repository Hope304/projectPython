All my questions were met with personal answers!""I had the best experience with David today. I was very at ease with the experience and all my questions were met with personal answers. I did not feel like it was a "vomit" of what could have been said but was personally driven to meet me where I am at and to my goals. Some professionals just say the same things over and over this was not my experience. I look forward to what’s next in the training and am grateful to this team for taking the time to better others and to actually teach!!"Stephanie J. 7 Year Client"Incredibly - The Best!""I was struggling with childhood trauma, buried emotions & challenges within myself & relationships that I didn't know how to address. I stepped into my personal power with his guidance. With David, you get realness, non-judgement & the ability to open up & talk about things that you need to release. He provides the space for you to be vulnerable so you could break through those challenges within that hold you back from living a fruitful, fulfilling, & joyous life from within..."Tracy C. "Safe To Express Everything""Beautiful Breakthrough! Working with David was like a dream. He listened to me with so much compassion. I felt safe to express everything that I was feeling no matter how different or weird it seemed to my human brain. He allowed me to feel safe exploring parts of myself that I never had the safety to explore in the past. I'm very grateful for the time spent with David, and with myself. It gave me a newfound appreciation for this work & my life in general. I would recommend him to everyone I know & actually I recommended him to my parents not too long after my session. I'm sure he could make anyone feel comfortable to explore even the most unexplored parts of themselves. I will definitely be working with him again. Thank you. :)"Shae M.
