Through rich colors and sparkling fireflies, the book’s message of comfort, adventure, and empowerment shines through like the moon and lights the way to inspire children to follow their dreams. Adapted from one of Jesse Terry's favorite and most requested songs, "If I Were the Moon," this enchanted tale follows the magical and dreamlike journey of Lily Grace. The moon guides Lily and her animal friends through moonlit forests and many other adventures before transporting her back to her bedroom. Safely tucked into bed with the moon still shining brightly outside her window, Lily drifts off to sleep. Was it all just a dream? Order Signed Copies Here!
