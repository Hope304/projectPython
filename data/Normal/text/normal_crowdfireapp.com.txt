It is intuitive and it allows me to schedule everything perfectly. Before Crowdfire, it was painful and it did not work well for me. I had to be sure I had fewer words for Twitter and pictures were not transferring really well. Crowdfire is doing that for me now and I really appreciate the reporting each week. Works like a charm and I love the ease of the app. I really recommend it for your business!" Eddie Darac Gestion BSP As a small business owner, I strive for the utmost efficiency on a daily basis. Crowdfire has been a lifesaver when it comes to scheduling our social media! I can sit down and schedule out weeks in advance, freeing me up to focus on sales.

George Shoemaker George Shoemaker, Partner, Currency Coffee Coffee blender, a taster of everything, sales geek, humanist, libertari The Crowdfire app has outstanding publishing features that other social media tools cannot offer. Consistent presentation with video previews, hashtags, and photos make posts look handcrafted every time. Best of all is the affordability of the tool compared to others." Paul Trinidad Software Consultant and Social Media Marketer I am loving using Crowdfire! As a content creator and social media manager, I have many accounts to manage and my time is extremely valuable. If you are a business owner, you know this, and let me tell you, you need Crowdfire! The most useful feature for sure is the calendar. It allows me to easily drop in content, so I can spend more time creating and editing, and less time uploading and posting. Being able to visualize all of the content for the month that I have already created allows me to effectively plan out what I still need to create, and seeing it right in front of me helps me protect my precious time! If you are like me and you manage multiple accounts, you can connect all of them and it is super intuitive to use! I highly recommend Crowdfire to anyone in the digital space!" Courtney Mixon Courtney is a social media manager & content creator based out of Atlanta, Georgia. She specializes in fitness marketing and works with big box gyms, boutique fitness studios, wellness spaces, physical therapists and more I have worked with a lot of social software tools over the years but I find the Crowdfire app very intuitive and easy to use. My staff and clients can get what they need done when they need it quickly and easily. The reporting adds a lot of value and is delivered on time every week right into our inboxes. I would highly recommend Crowdfire to any business or marketing professionals." Jamie CEO + Founder Howto.Marketing We have been using social media for promotion for several years and so far we have worked with several different providers. We also started working with Crowdfire where we found that they offer the most in terms of price. Their platform is very transparent and easy to use. The big advantage is that the add-ons can be added separately and very easily. They offer a lot of add-ons for a very affordable price, but their competition offers half as many for the same price. I recommend their application to anyone who wants an easy way and fast way to create ads. It must also be emphasized that in addition to the typical ways of advertising, it is also possible to arrange specific things so that each user can make their work as easy as possible and choose what they really need."

Emily Sims I am the General Manager of Prosper Australia. Our mission is to secure genuine equality of opportunity. We conduct research and educate decision-makers and the general public in the economics of monopoly rent and locational advantage.

CrowdFire completely changed my way of managing my account. I now spend minimum time, while CrowdFire automatically posts during the "Best-Time" eventually leading to maximum reach" Priyanka Giri That CSE Engineer on Twitter Crowfire has been amazing for my small business. It saves me so much time in regards to posting as I can schedule way in advance both for marketing and also managing my client groups.
