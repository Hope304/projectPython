Without either sign or sound of their shock, The waves flow’d over the Inchcape Rock; So little they rose, so little they fell, They did not move the Inchcape Bell. The worthy Abbot of Aberbrothok Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock; On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung, And over the waves its warning rung. When the Rock was hid by the surge’s swell, The Mariners heard the warning Bell; And then they knew the perilous Rock, And blest the Abbot of Aberbrothok The Sun in the heaven was shining gay, All things were joyful on that day; The sea-birds scream’d as they wheel’d round, And there was joyaunce in their sound. The buoy of the Inchcpe Bell was seen A darker speck on the ocean green; Sir Ralph the Rover walk’d his deck, And fix’d his eye on the darker speck. He felt the cheering power of spring, It made him whistle, it made him sing; His heart was mirthful to excess, But the Rover’s mirth was wickedness. His eye was on the Inchcape Float; Quoth he, “My men, put out the boat, And row me to the Inchcape Rock, And I’ll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok.” The boat is lower’d, the boatmen row, And to the Inchcape Rock they go; Sir Ralph bent over from the boat, And he cut the bell from the Inchcape Float. Down sank the Bell with a gurgling sound, The bubbles rose and burst around; Quoth Sir Ralph, “The next who comes to the Rock, Won’t bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok.” Sir Ralph the Rover sail’d away, He scour’d the seas for many a day; And now grown rich with plunder’d store, He steers his course for Scotland’s shore. So thick a haze o’erspreads the sky, They cannot see the sun on high; The wind hath blown a gale all day, At evening it hath died away. On the deck the Rover takes his stand, So dark it is they see no land. Quoth Sir Ralph, “It will be lighter soon, For there is the dawn of the rising Moon.” “Canst hear,” said one, “the breakers roar? For methinks we should be near the shore.” “Now, where we are I cannot tell, But I wish we could hear the Inchcape Bell.” They hear no sound, the swell is strong, Though the wind hath fallen they drift along; Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock, “Oh Christ! It is the Inchcape Rock!” Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair, He curst himself in his despair; The waves rush in on every side, The ship is sinking beneath the tide. But even is his dying fear, One dreadful sound could the Rover hear; A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell, The Devil below was ringing his knell. © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes Read more →Analysis (ai): This poem narrates a tale of Sir Ralph the Rover, a ruthless pirate, who cuts the warning bell from the Inchcape Rock. Despite the calm weather and cheerful atmosphere, Ralph's malicious act foreshadows his impending doom. As the poem progresses, the tone shifts to one of fear and anxiety. The thick haze and rising moon create an atmosphere of uncertainty, while the sound of the breakers indicates the proximity of danger. The absence of the bell's warning sound becomes a haunting reminder of Ralph's recklessness. The poem concludes with the ship striking the rock and the despair of Sir Ralph. The sound of the bell ringing below symbolizes the ultimate retribution for his evil deed. The poem's concise and straightforward language effectively conveys the themes of good versus evil, justice, and the consequences of actions. Compared to Southey's other works, "Inchcape Rock" lacks the introspective and melancholic nature of his later poems. Instead, it presents a more straightforward and action-packed narrative. In terms of the time period, the poem reflects the prevailing Romantic fascination with the power of nature and the consequences of human intervention.Read more → Like (74) 37 Good poem Clever write Inspired me Like (74) Sorry, this post can only be viewed by registered users: Aashar2022/11/10 - TuniSorry, this post can only be viewed by registered users: Burnt Moon - PoetdeeBarddylbach Followon Aug 05 2020 12:16 AM PST • picked on Mar 05 2024 11:30 AM PST SinhakkenThe world here is plain and pretty, all but functional flat and round.
