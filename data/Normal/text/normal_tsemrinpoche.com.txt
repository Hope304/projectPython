Samfoonheei Monday, Mar 4. 2024 06:59 PM An inspiring act of a selfless Lama feeding strays whether its night or day. Truly an example for us all to feed those lonely strays . Yes I do agree compassion starts with feeding strays. Reading this blog again to refresh myself to do more. Strays animals generally lead a life of poor welfare on the street. Feeding strays is a compassionate act. Thank you Rinpoche and Anila for this sharing. https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/one-minute-story/rinpoche-through-my-eyes-compassion-starts-with-feeding-strays reply Samfoonheei Monday, Mar 4. 2024 06:56 PM nteresting revisit this blog again as truly inspiring reading over and over again .

We know they do exist and I believe they do. They have no physical form to them whatsoever. Demons do definitely exist. They are intelligent beings who are evil malicious spirits and are all dangerous entities. Valak is not to be summoned capriciously by anyone as they are dangerous beings when we invoke them having to face a heavy consequence. There are spiritual practices that we can ask for help a ritual of the wrathful Manjushri in the form of Trakze. Having a doing the practice daily without fail, consistently, as this Trakze practice has been proven to be efficacious to break the hold the Valak and other spirits. All thanks to our Guru bringing this practice to Kechara Forest Retreat, Bentong Malaysia. Thank you Rinpoche for this wonderful sharing for us to understand better. https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/science-mysteries/valak-the-conjuring-2-demon.html reply Samfoonheei Monday, Mar 4. 2024 06:53 PM Wow ,reading all these powerful quotes had me realised much better of giving even I have little. May H E Tsem Rinpoche’s sincere advice to reach the far shore of liberation to everyone reading this blog. The most truly generous people are those who give silently without asking any in return. There is no exercise better than reaching and lifting people up. A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. Well creating and lighting for others we naturally light our own way. Helping others especially those unfortunate ones, make us feel more positive about our own circumstances.

Lama Tsongkhapa was hailed as the second Buddha by contemporary Buddhist masters of his time. Famous for reviving Buddhism in Tibet and revered for elevating the Dharma to all its present glory. Hence having a 12 ft Lama Tsongkhapa Statue at new Kechara Gompa (Prayer Hall) is indeed a blessing. Its truly beautiful. Merely by looking at it is a blessing . Thank you Rinpoche and team effort making it possible. https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/kechara-13-depts/10-ft-tsongkapa-here.html reply Samfoonheei Thursday, Jan 4. 2024 04:09 PM The Pemayangtse Monastery is a Buddhist monastery, near Pelling in the northeastern Sikkim. The monastery is about 375 year old and is one of the oldest and premier monasteries of Sikkim. Its also the most famous monastery in Sikkim and one of the most important monastery belonging to the Nyingma order of Tibetan Buddhism. Pemayangtse monastery was founded around 1647-48 recording to history. Well the Monastery is part of Buddhist religious pilgrimage circuit built with scenic backdrop of snow-capped mountains on two sides. Where many locals and tourists will travel to Sikkim yearly . Over the centuries, the monastery has withstood earthquakes and has gone through series of refurbishments and preservation efforts. Interesting story behind this monastery, would love to travel to Sikkim again . Lieutenant Colonel Laurence Austine Waddell was a British explorer, collector in Tibet, and author, travelling throughout India,Sikkim and areas on the borders of Nepal and Tibet. He wrote about the Tibetan Buddhist religious practices from what he observed while there. In Sikkim he made a stunning discovery, that Dorje Shugden existence in the Nyingma monastery as written in his book. Hence it has proven that Dorje Shugden been worshipped not only in Gelug lineage but as well in the Nyingma centuries ago too. Its not a minority practice afterall . Thank you Rinpoche and Seow Choong Liang for this interesting sharing. https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/dorje-shugden-in-nyingma-pemayangtse-monastery-sikkim.html reply Samfoonheei Thursday, Jan 4. 2024 04:07 PM Revisit this interesting post of a great Master Buton Rinchen Drup, was a 14th-century Sakya master and Tibetan Buddhist leader. He is widely considered to be one of Tibet’s greatest scholars, historians, translators, and writers. He has been the role model for many of Tibet’s greatest masters over the centuries, including the present Dalai Lama. His legacy also included the compilation of 500 years’ worth of translated teachings into the encyclopedic Kangyur and Tangyur collections. This monumental effort helped to preserve and propagate the teachings throughout Tibet. These collections have become well known by all of the schools of Buddhism in Tibet, and continue to this day. He truly was one of the brightest lights of Tibetan Buddhism. Throughout his life, Buton Rinchen Drup has continued to serve humanity and the Dharma. Interesting read.

Toyuq, an Islamic pilgrimage center, nestles at the base of the Flaming Mountains. Here there are many mosques, both medieval and modern ones been built over the years. The first Uighur ruler had converted to Islam, and shrines was then built in the locality honouring the ruler. There was a story behind the legendary Seven Sleepers of Ephesus where there was a group of youths hiding inside a cave, at the Flaming mountains outside the city of Ephesus around 250 AD. Buildings can be seen practically everywhere with pierced walls that is used for drying grapes to make raisins. Raisins and melons are most known products of the region. Turpan is one of the most densely populated cities in Xinjiang the popukation consists of mainly the Muslim Uyghurs.

He was also commonly known as Takpu Dorje Chang who had many authentic visions of the Buddhas. He had even received directly teachings from Buddhas. He had received direct visions of Tara herself. Tagpu Pemavajra had travelled to Tushita, the heavenly abode of Lama Tsongkhapa as requested by Kyabje Pabongka Rinpoche where he received the complete cycle of teachings on Dorje Shugden. Tagpu Pemavajra was one such lama who was attained enough to receive these teachings for the benefit of others. He was instrumental in the development of the Dorje Shugden practice within the Gelug tradition. Wow he was able to astral travel to various pure lands and receive special teachings.

It’s the oldest Buddhist manuscripts yet discovered, dating from about the 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE.

We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, and greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complex than ours they moved finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth." ~ Henry Beston, The Outermost House "Not eating animals is only unnatural when we are not used to it." ~ Tsem Rinpoche MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES "We may encounter defeat, but we must not be defeated." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "What you are today, is the choice you made yesterday." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "You think you can choose your life? What an ego trip!" ~ Lama Yeshe "If TODAY you are dissatisfied, you must make the changes to create different results for TOMORROW." ~ Tsem Rinpoche SPIRITUAL QUOTES “Meditating on Dorje Shugden while reciting his mantra will open the gateways to higher dimensions, blessings and protection.” ~ Tsem Rinpoche “If one does the recitation of the Lama Tsongkhapa guru yoga prayer for even one month using one of the visualizations for great or clear or quick wisdom, one will definitely see development of that wisdom. It is proved by experience. There is no doubt that by doing the Lama Tsongkhapa guru yoga practice one can meet Lama Tsongkhapa’s teachings from life to life. And furthermore, it gives one the opportunity to be born in the pure realm of Lama Tsongkhapa, Tushita, whenever death happens.” ~ Pabongkha Rinpoche "I was 18 years old in 1983. That was a very special year as I met His Holiness Kyabje Zong Rinpoche and received innumerable precious teachings and empowerments from Him at Thubten Dhargye Ling Centre in Los Angeles, California. It was the best time of my life. A time that seems so magical and surreal to me. Kyabje Zong Rinpoche is Heruka Buddha and I met Heruka." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "If being me offends you, maybe I'm not the problem." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "Never abandon your spiritual teacher no matter how many inner obstacles you need to overcome." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "Actions to force something to be permanent makes all the karmas arise." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "The dharma is not easy to listen to… because some people take it as criticism. But Dharma should not be just feel good only for the moment but for deeper contemplations." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "Whether we do work and suffer but for others or we do work and suffer for ourselves, either way we have to suffer. That is the nature of samsara. So let us suffer for others and then suffering has meaning." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "Those who really want the dharma to grow within themselves and to grow for others should never fear hard work, timing, difficulties, struggles, disappointments because it is for a good cause. Working for Dharma is not a prison or work, but it is purely spiritual practice. It is purely collection of merit and purification. Actually not doing dharma work is the real prison." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "His Holiness Zong Rinpoche stressed the need to continue to practice even when we come up against obstacles, and that we should continually review our progress. He stated that a happy, luxurious life was like a good dream, and that obstacles and difficulties were like a bad dream. We should give them no significance, but simply carry on working towards real, everlasting happiness." ~ Ngala ’ö-Dzin Tridral "Things in samsara always go wrong. That's its nature. Don't be surprised." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "Knowledge never quenches the thirst, only application." ~ Tsem Rinpoche LIFE QUOTES "I pity men who occupy themselves exclusively with the transitory in things and lose themselves in the study of what is perishable, since we are here for this very end-that we may make the perishable imperishable, which we can do only after we have learned how to approach both." ~ Johann Wolfgang von Goethe "Money amplifies negative characteristics and that can cause problems. To walk away from that was actually very easy. I didn't even consider it." ~ Angeline Francis Khoo "I shall not commit the fashionable stupidity of regarding everything I cannot explain as a fraud." ~ Carl Jung "There is a devil there is no doubt, but is he trying to get into us or trying to get out?" ~ Tsem Rinpoche "If you love someone, show it by being honest, respectful & honorable with them." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see." ~ Henry David Thoreau "If I can just be the way I am & you the way you are & we accept each other, world peace is near." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "I am Asian, you are some other beautiful color. Together we make diversity so beautiful." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "It's amazing how some people have never met me or know who I am, but based on a few things they read here & there & rumours, they have formulated a new personality for me & all the things I've never done they passionately speak about....I find it funny and entertaining now. I guess we can't spend our lives fighting rumours...we just have to work hard & then rumours get proven wrong on it's own as a by product. No point explaining repeatedly. Just do our work & show results!!" ~ Tsem Rinpoche "There's a difference between patience and laziness. Patience comes from respect while laziness from disrespect of others." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "Although outwardly we have so much, we have so many conveniences, inwardly we have become more unhappy, so, acquisition is not the secret to happiness. The more we get, the more we have, the more unhappy we become." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "Before we experience any pain, we already had a fixed view of how things should be. When the experience we encounter contradicts our views, then the pain arises. The pain arises due to our fixed views not so much the experience itself. So the secret is changing the views. Re-educating ourselves on our views." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "You know since very young, for better or worse, I always did the things that others told me not to do. I wasn't really good at following the rules. Even now with how I share Dharma and my practice, I just do it the way I think it should be done but I do it sincerely. Not what others tell me what I can and can't do." ~ Tsem Rinpoche "Love me or hate me, both are in my favor... If you love me, I'll always be in your heart... If you hate me, I'll always be in your mind." ~ William Shakespeare "One isn't necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can't be kind, true, merciful, generous or honest." ~ Maya Angelou Devotional Songs Sung by Mary Fewel Tulin, these mystical songs in praise of the guru originate from the Sikh tradition. Yet, they are applicable to all traditions for those who want to venerate their guru.

The Unknown The Known and unknown are both feared, Known is being comfortable and stagnant, The unknown may be growth and opportunities, One shall never know if one fears the unknown more than the known. Who says the unknown would be worse than the known? But then again, the unknown is sometimes worse than the known. In the end nothing is known unless we endeavour, So go pursue all the way with the unknown, because all unknown with familiarity becomes the known. ~Tsem Rinpoche Photos On The GoClick on the images to view the bigger version.

That's the business model. How quickly they can be made to grow, how tightly they can be packed, how much or how little can they eat, how sick they can get without dying...

If you see this, I want to say thanks for taking the time to answer my question. Is Buddhism and Activism compatible? Green Tara's embodiment of "compassion in action" inspires me to speak out against injustices and social issues that are happening around the world right now. I want to make change and put my compassion for the suffering into action such as volunteering helping or donating to organizations that help the poor and needy, stray animals, etc. Is this compatible with Green Tara's "activity" aspect? or does it mean something different? I am not a Buddhist so I don't know for sure. Still, I like what the goddess represents. That's all of my questions, thanks again!No reply yetMarch 3, 2024 17:42Bhavisha asked: I live in india and hindu by birth. People worship here tons of locan deities about which i don't know whether they are enlighten or not. So what should I do regarding offerings and worship of them. Many people take trance of these local deities and i saw positive effect of this to people in the form of healing, answers of unclarity and future and blessings. But also once spiritually advanced lady told me who is from foreign that most of locan deities are nasty Astral entities and u should never worship them. So put light on this whole topic that which deity i should pay respect and do offerings and how to know if the one is enlighten or not...and if one is not enlighten will i face averse effects by worshiping and paying respect and taking refuge....No reply yetFebruary 29, 2024 08:13tristanngxingming727@gmail.com asked: Hi Pastor Last night I got bad dreams Kena ganggu The dream I in hotel holiday the next bed in the room got a white shirt lady facing the wall long hair and the TV in the dream on by itself then I got shock wake up Get up hear the water dripping in my toilet 🚽 I go see nothing but keep hearing in my house and a lot of ther exprirencesNo reply yetFebruary 28, 2024 22:00Rojal Poudel asked: What will Kechara Team do for the 5th parinirvana anniversary of our dear Tsem Rinpoche?

Every time you invoke Dorje Shugden, he comes with his entourage. You can read about his entourage here: https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/one-minute-story/the-entourage-of-the-king-dorje-shugden They are actually his various emanations for specific purposes that you can read about in the article. By extension, when you invokve Dorje Shugden, Lord Setrap also comes, as within the mandala of Dorje Shugden, Lord Setrap and his entire entourage are above Dorje Shugden. Then you also have Kache Marpo: https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/who-is-kache-marpo.html And Namkha Barzin: https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/invocation-to-namkar-barzin.html Through Kache Marpo, as part of his own retinue are: Methar: https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/great-lamas-masters/methar-of-tengyeling-monastery.html And Shangmo Dorje Putri: https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/shangmo-dorje-putri-the-bamo-of-sakya.html There are others also. On a side note, during the monthly Dorje Shugden Fulfilment Ritual (Kangsol) puja, the following protectors are also propitiated for their assistance, during the extended serkym (golden tea) section of the puja: Six-Armed Mahakala, White Mahakala, Kalarupa (https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/kalarupa.html), Palden Lhamo Magzor Gyalmo (https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/palden-lhamo.html), Panjaranatha Mahakala, Four-Armed Mahakala (https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/is-negativity-really-negative.html), Vaishravana & Begtse Chen (https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/the-dharma-protector-begtse-chen.html).

Thank you.February 21, 2024 10:25Karma Tashi asked: Hello, i want to ask whether i can chant short mandala practice without complete altar offerings? pastor answered: Dear Karma Tashi, Yes it is possible to chant and practise the short mandala offering without completely offerings on your altar. The mandala offering is a visualised offering of the entire universe, so it doesn't rely on specific offerings on your altar. However, it also depends on how you are practising the mandala offering. For example, it is usually practised in the context of a sadhana. That sadhana itself may require certain sets of offerings for the particular deity. So you would need to have those offerings related to the practice on you altar to engage in those specific prayers. You can read a very good article about mandala offerings here: https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/mandala-offering-a-powerful-method-to-accumulate-merits.html I hope this helps. Thank you.February 20, 2024 18:07Leo asked: Hello Pastors: Do you have read this prayer to Pehar Gyalpo Ku Nga composed by H.H 14th DalaiLama? He regard Gyalpo Ku Nga is Enlightenment Dharmapala such as they are the wisdom of the sugatas of the five families. https://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/fourteenth-dalai-lama/nechung-activity-encouragement Is it safe to prayer to Him now? Thanks.pastor answered: Dear Leo, Thank you for your message. We have not come across this prayer before, so thank you for sending us the link. I don't have the authority to comment if it is safe to pray to Pehar Gyalpo Ku Nga or not. Generally speaking, he has definitely been relied on as a Dharma protector within our lineage and can be very beneficial for pracitioners. However, his practise, is always given and done under strict supervision of your guru, hence he is not a protector that is commonly practised. Most lamas, Tsem Rinpoche included, recommended relying on Dharma protectors that are more commonly relied upon within our lineage, such as Dorje Shugden, Setrap, Kalarupa, Vaishravana, Mahakala, Palden Lhamo, etc. You can find an article about Dharma protectors here: https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/dharma-protectors-of-tibetan-buddhism.html You can also find the prayers to various protectors that are definitely safe to practise, even without the strict supervision of a guru here: https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/category/prayers-and-sadhanas I hope all this helps. Thank you.February 16, 2024 21:19Rojal Poudel asked: What can we do to ensure that Tsem rinpoche has a swift and quick reincarnation? Is there a specifc amount of mantra recition or pujas we have to do? Sorry for asking so many questions.pastor answered: Dear Rojal Poudel, Thank you for your question. In regards to prayers we can do for Rinpoche's swift return and that the incarnation returns to Kechara to teach, the following have been recommended: > Swift Return Puja: available here https://www.tsemtulku.com/swift-return-puja/ This can be done individually or you can join us once a week online, to do the puja together. This is livestreamed on our Kecharians and Friends FaceBook Page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/kecharians Group puja is livestreamed every Thursday at 8pm Malaysia time (GMT +8) > Reciting one or more of Tsem Rinpoche's Swift Return Prayers and recitation of his name mantra. These are available here: https://www.tsemtulku.com/swift-return-prayers/ > Recitation of Chanting the Names of Manjushri prayer (which actually forms the major part of the Swift Return Puja, you can find the prayer there) or here: https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/buddhas-dharma/all-about-manjushri.html (in the Daily Prayers section) > Dorje Shugden's practice with more recitation of the Kawang prayer. This is included in the daily Diamond Path sadhana: https://www.vajrasecrets.com/diamond-path You can recite Kawang 7, 21 or 108 times according your timing and dedicate towards Rinpoche's swift rebirth. > If you have been taught how, then you can also engage in the practice of Drugchuma, which is a puja to Kalarupa to remove obstacles for Rinpoche's Swift Rebirth. There is no specific amount of the above to be reached, but we have been advised to do as much as possible. In addition to that, we should transform our minds as much as possible following Rinpoche's explanation of the teachings. The more we transform, and change our minds, the more merit we create. The key to all Buddhist practice, including creating the merit necessary for Rinpoche's return is self-transformation. That is the highest form of practice and offering. I hope this helps. Thank you.February 14, 2024 05:28Atom Seven or ID name Pedro Neves Mota asked: First of all thank you for all that you are offering free here in your web house. I would like to ask which name I should use: Pedro Neves Mota (ID) or Atom Seven 12 years ago I moved to Berlin and finally I changed my name to Atom Seven, using my family names backwards Neves Mota. my question is do I need to use the ID name or the name I am now know in the world for astrology purposes?pastor answered: Hello Atom Seven, This actually depends on the system of astrology you are using. For example, the Chinese, Indian and Tibetan forms of astrology work solely from your date of birth. In fact in some forms of Indian and Tibetan astrology, your name is actually chosen from your astrology chart. So the most important thing for these forms of astrology is that date of birth, not the name. In other forms, for example Numerology, then yes, the name comes into play. I'm not that well versed in Numerology, so cannot help to answer from that side. But I think you would use the name that you go by now. The reason being, our names have a certain energy to shape us. That's why sometimes in Tibetan Buddhism, we are actually advised to change our name when going through certain difficult situations. Of course it's not just the change of name, but prayers, pujas, motivation, etc that really changes our life situations. Hope this helps. Thank you.February 13, 2024 10:02Rojal Poudel asked: Has Tsem Rinpoche reincarnated again?pastor answered: Dear Rojal Poudel, As of today, we have not found or enthroned Tsem Rinpoche's incarnation. We are still carrying out the process and creating the causes for Rinpoche to return by continuing his work to benefit others.
