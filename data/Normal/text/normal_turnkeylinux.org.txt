"Best effort" free support is always available via the TurnKey forums. Read more about Benefits Turnkey GNU/Linux is a free Debian based library of system images that pre-integrates and polishes the best free software components into secure, easy to use solutions. TurnKey is inspired by a belief in the democratizing power of free software, like science, to promote the progress of a free & humane society. Without the freedom to freely distribute, tinker and learn from free software the Internet as we know it would not exist. Free software is the silent, often invisible power behind the greatest technological marvel of our era. At the time of writing Debian, the largest GNU/Linux distribution has over 37,500 packages in its software repositories. The free software movement has collectively created a treasure trove of software that anyone is free to use, distribute, modify and learn from. Unfortunately, much of this treasure is locked away because too few know about it and even fewer have the skills to take full advantage of it. Imagine how much good we could do if changed that. That's our vision and we invite you to join the mission.
