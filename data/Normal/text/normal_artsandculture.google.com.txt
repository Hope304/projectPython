The Meroe cemetery, Musawwarat es-Sufra and Naqa are located in a semi-desert, set against reddish-brown hills.The pyramids at Meroe are outstanding examples of Kushite funerary monuments, which illustrate the association with the well preserved remains of the urban centre of the Kushite capital city, Meroe.Immerse yourself in the heart of an ancient city and discover Meroe, the ancient capital of the Kushite Kingdom, in the Nile Valley in Sudan, here.The architectural remains at the three site components illustrate the juxtaposition of structural and decorative elements from Pharaonic Egypt, Greece, and Rome as well as from Kush itself, and through this represent a significant reference of early exchange and diffusion of styles and technologies.The site of Musawwarat es-Sufra, known to the Kushites as Aborepe, lies around 40 km south of Meroe. Constructed in sandstone, one of its features, the Great Enclosure, comprises individual buildings, store rooms, workshops, kitchens, walled enclosures, and ramps. The Lion Temple in Musawwarat es-sufra is situated about 600 m southeast of the Great Enclosure. It is a typical Meroitic one-roomed temple, dedicated to the lion god Apedemak, an indigenous Kushite god.The site encompasses a wide range of architectural forms, including pyramids, temples, palaces, and industrial areas that shaped the political, religious, social, artistic and technological scene of the Middle and Northern Nile Valley for more than 1000 years (8th century BC-4th century AD).The Lion (Apedemak) temple, here in Naqa, is considered a classic example of Kushite architecture. Apedemak was a lion-headed warrior god worshipped in Nubia.The front of the temple is an extensive gateway, and depicts Natakamani and Amanitore on the left and right exerting divine power over their prisoners, symbolically with lions at their feet. The Kiosk is a small rectangular sandstone structure preserved almost to its roof level, standing a few metres to the east of the Lion Temple.Architectural and decorative elements show Pharaonic Egyptian, Hellenistic and local artistic influences and the building is thought to be a shrine to the goddess Hathor. The Amun Temple stands to the east of the Kiosk. It is built of sandstone, red brick and mud brick. It is approached from the west by a long ramp which is lined on each side with six ram figures and is interrupted in the centre by a sandstone kiosk.The Archaeological Sites of the Island of Meroe was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2011 under Criteria: (ii)(iii)(iv)(v).The treasure hunting of Ferlini in the 1830s was very deleterious to some of the pyramids in the Meroe cemeteries. Inappropriate interventions which reduced the integrity of the site have not occurred since then.The Archaeological Sites of the Island of Meroe reflect the interchange of ideas and contact between Sub-Saharan Africa and the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern worlds, along what was a major trade corridor over a very long period of time. The interaction of local and foreign influences is demonstrated by the preserved architectural remains and their iconography.The property with its wide range of monument types, well preserved buildings, and potential for future excavation and research, contributes an exceptional testimony to the wealth and power of the former Kushite state and its extensive contacts with African, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern societies.The Kushite civilization was largely expunged by the arrival of Christianity on the Middle Nile in the 6th century CE.The three site components selected represent the capital city of the Kushite kingdom, Meroe, with its associated extensive burial grounds of pyramid tombs, and the kingdom’s two largest hinterland centres, Musawwarat es-Sufra and Naqa. Together they provide evidence of the size, and influence of the Kushite civilization at the height of power.Pyramids around the worldModern art in SudanToday in historyOn this day in 1696, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo was bornGiovanni Battista Tiepolo, also known as Giambattista Tiepolo, was an Italian painter and printmaker from the Republic of Venice who painted in the Rococo style, considered important member of the 18th-century Venetian school. He was prolific, and worked not only in Italy, but also in Germany and Spain. Giovan Battista Tiepolo, together with Giambattista Pittoni, Canaletto, Giovan Battista Piazzetta, Giuseppe Maria Crespi, and Francesco Guardi are considered the traditional Old Masters of that period. Successful from the beginning of his career, he has been described by Michael Levey as "the greatest decorative painter of eighteenth-century Europe, as well as its most able craftsman."Learn moreFollow Us on InstagramKeep up with the latest from arts and cultureRecommended for youDiscover popular artworks and hidden gems from around the worldThe ScreamEdvard Munch4 Things You Might Not Know About 'The Scream'Related storyDeath in the SickroomFrom related movementThe Voice / Summer NightDepicts same location7 Things You May Not Know About Edvard MunchRelated storyNo specific sign of culture is independent of a broader historical text, and no broad historical text or world view is independent of the broader enigma of the universeDepicts similar personOld Kirk BraddanUses same mediumCamarasaurusDepicts similar personMaking wavesArtworks showing the storm-toss'd seaLeonardo da VinciRoyal Collection TrustHokusaiTokyo National MuseumWinslow HomerPhiladelphia Museum of ArtJ.

However, today's experts believe that it actually dates from 1913 and that it was intended as a draft for another work 'Composition VII'.First draftIt has been questioned whether this is a study made before the completion of another work. The style of this watercolor and the management of space suggest that this piece is closer to paintings done a few years later in 1913.Drawings vs. colorThis work is made up of watercolor touches overlaid with black lines drawn with pen and ink, dissociating the roles of drawing and color from one another.MovementThe lines provide no outlines for the shapes, instead lending them a rhythmic sense of movement around the work.Floating in spaceThe patches of color float in space in an liberated way. This is a common feature of works dating from after 1912: before then, the colors remained structured by images, which referenced Kandinsky's memory and personal recollections.Untitled, Kandinsky, 1913Click on the dots to zoom into the detailsExplore6 photographs, 6 continentsDiscover photography around the world'Outside Looking In' by Gordon ParksFrom the High Museum of Art'To Raise the Water Level in a Fish Pond' by Zhang HuanFrom the Asia Society'C-Stunners' by Cyrus KabiruFrom the African Artists' Foundation'The Migrant' by Jacqui Stockdale,From the Australian National Portrait Gallery'Traditional Women’s Costume' by Mario TestinoFrom Museo Mario TestinoFollow your favoritesThe New York Botanical GardenUnited StatesGarden MuseumUnited KingdomHo Family GardenChinaDMZ Botanic GardenSouth KoreaKlehm Arboretum & Botanic GardenUnited StatesDiscover 3,000+ collectionsMuseum spotlightCreated in 1948, Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro (MAM Rio) occupies a singular position in Brazilian artSee the collectionCheck out the viewTwo vistas from SloveniaIn lifeIn artWestern CapeMountains of the WorldDiscover SloveniaExplore in 3DSearch 3D objectsZoom inMusic's biggest names narrate famous artworksFeist on Pieter Bruegel the ElderA master of pop on a master of paintZoom Into 'The Tower of Babel'See Pieter Bruegel the Elder's dizzying details, up closeKeep exploring...Dive into culture from around the worldExploring the Maya WorldA journey into the pastExploreMeet the People of KenyaFrom the cradle of mankindExploreWonders of PakistanDiscover the cultural treasuresExploreWayang Shadow PuppetsStyle, epic stories, and surprisesExploreCuban Arts & CultureArtworks, archives, and storiesExploreA Century of Polish ArtThe inspirations and impact of artistsExploreMeet Lee UngnoA new look at the pioneering artistExploreJourney Around MexicoUnique landscapes and ancient heritageExploreTranslate with GoogleGoogle apps
