Reviewsâ˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…It is essential in our computerWhat do you like best? can be downloaded for free in its free version, and its main task is to detect and remove corrupt files, suspicious or spyware robots, which can be harmful to our computer. The design of this program is really simple, with practically four buttons, to do everything, but still, it has many options. What most attracts the attention of the program, at least to me, is the possibility of configuring it in several languages. What do you dislike? They should add other skins. and it has a relatively high Ram Consumption [Note from Safer-Networking: this has been fixed in Spybot 2.7]. Recommendations to others considering the product I recommend it because it is free and has a simple interface with intuitive options, it is effective, it removes malware, and it is always updated. What business problems are you solving with the product? What benefits have you realized? protection in the work stations in combination with other antivirus makes me feel more protective against computer intrusions and malicious advertising. â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…This is a great fully-featured security applicationâ€¦Pros: Host File Protection, Browser Guards, Realtime Spyware and Malware Protection, Process Control, Deep System Scanning, and many others you normally wouldnâ€™t find in a traditional security software suite. Cons: The only con I can rightly say is that it consumes a lot of system resources and some of the scans can take a while, depending on the size of your system and the configurations of the scan you choose. Summary: This is a robust security application that is an excellent supplement to existing security software and especially useful for those whom still use the Internet Explorer browser, because of the protections it offers, including that of the host file as well as a userâ€™s homepage. Even if you donâ€™t want to pay for the full version, the free version is still worth the download and is a formidable contender in the world of antimalware software. â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…Fred KoudijzerUsing the program for many years with great satisfaction! +++ For our international clients Safer-Networking Ltd.
