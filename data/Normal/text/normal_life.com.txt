The singer-songwriter not only left an imprint on the era’s music, he was a friend or muse to many of those who made it, from Crosby, Stills and Nash to the Beatles and Jackson Browne; from Joni Mitchell and Carole King to his first wife, Carly Simon. Today, Taylor remains a force on the recording scene, having sold more than 100 million albums, winning six Grammys and being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He also continues to influence current hitmakers—pop phenomenon Taylor Swift was named for him—and perform around the world. This special edition of LIFE, with rare family and archival photos, tracks the rise of the man known to fans as JT, a beloved icon, and celebrates his achievements as an artist.
