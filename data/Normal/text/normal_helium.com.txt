For us, Helium is essential because the cost of and the barriers to installing a gateway to every single deployment would make those deployments much more difficult.”Charles Fayal, Co-Founder“Helium and the team at Nova Labs are always there for us, and we are looking forward to its new generation of technologies to see how we can help our customer base and to grow our business.”George Newman, Founder and CEO“M3 relies on Helium to provide the backbone for our business’s digital services, both internally for our own needs as well as externally to those of our customers.”Nathan Moses-Gonzales, CEO“The smaller size, long battery life and coverage beginning to approach cellular in certain regions makes Helium-based devices a potential disruptor for solutions such as tracking loved ones, packages, and even pets.”Michael Mathews, Co-Founder and President“The Helium Network enables us a low-cost network and peace of mind in connectivity and we utilize the Network on various university campuses, smart city applications, and workplace solutions.” Hasan Basri Tosun, Co-Founder and CEO“Thanks to the Helium Network, we can offer years of battery life. This is key for our business, as we provide survey terminals that can be placed anywhere, even when there is no power outlet in the area.”Jérôme Chambard, CEO“The Helium Network’s extended coverage lowers entry barriers for IoT deployment and rollouts, helping our customers in more than 70 countries to get their solutions up and running faster.”Reinhard Bischoff, CEOWith Helium, we can easily deploy a network of gateways to provide coverage around a ranch or area of interest instead of waiting months or years for a cellular tower to be built, which ultimately may never happen.”Thomas Remmert, Co-Founder and CTO“Communityfi.io chose Helium because it is the only network that enables our mission: To improve critical community services such as farms and food pantries through technology like refrigeration monitoring and vehicle tracking. Thanks to Helium we are able to make a positive impact in the world and do so without taking resources away from those in need.”Eugene McGrath, Co-Founder“Thanks to Helium's global coverage, we've been able to develop an asset tracking app that works with all existing LoRaWAN GPS trackers. This has allowed us to expand our business daily, with some major brands in the pipeline.”Neil Skoglund, CEO“We started our Helium project in September of 2021 and have huge plans with the Network. Our main goal is to deploy 10K hotspots.”Fabrizio Amodio, CEO“Previous solutions weren’t scaling well, so we began testing the Helium Network in Q3 2021, discovered the coverage was massive, and started deploying production devices Q1 2022.”Viktor Kanchev, CEO“CHOOVIO utilizes the Helium Network as a new method of deploying, maintaining, and capitalizing on physical wireless infrastructure. Our solutions + Helium provide everything needed to build a complete end-to-end IoT network.”Farhad Arvin, Founder“We are about to launch our first full pilot program in which we will be using the Helium Network for equipment monitoring, as well as monitoring and tracking services for packages, drones, robotics, and even lost pets.”Lora O'Toole, VP of Business Development“When a client installs one of our Helium capable units, the device will communicate the data over the Helium Network by connecting to the closest Helium hotspot, taking advantage of the network's massive coverage.”Ray Caccavale, US Manager“Since summer 2021, we have been working to introduce Helium to the Latin American IoT market. We’re currently developing an agricultural project using Helium that aims to reduce costs and increase operational efficiency.”Gabriel Marques, Co-Founder“We design and manufacture our own Helium-compatible IoT devices for the African market, including an Animal Movement Tracker that is used to send early warning notifications via the Helium Network for possible animal theft or attacks from wild animals.”Pieter de Wet, Enterprise Asset Manager“Our devices monitor water usage and help with leak detection. For us, Helium is essential because the cost of and the barriers to installing a gateway to every single deployment would make those deployments much more difficult.”Charles Fayal, Co-Founder“Helium and the team at Nova Labs are always there for us, and we are looking forward to its new generation of technologies to see how we can help our customer base and to grow our business.”George Newman, Founder and CEOLatest News UpdateNetwork ScalabilityHelium Network boosts speed and reliability with upgrade to Solana BlockchainMobile CarrierNova Labs and T-Mobile Collaborate on Cryptocarrier, Helium MobileCoverage IntegrationHelium Connects Senet Customers in NYCRoaming PartnerActility and Helium Announce Roaming IntegrationMine.Build the Future of WirelessBy deploying a Helium Hotspot in your home, office, or elsewhere in the wild, you can provide your town with wireless network coverage for low power “internet of things” or cellular devices and earn Helium tokens.Learn MoreBYE BYE GPU MININGMining Helium tokens with Hotspots is done via radio technology, not expensive or wasteful GPUs.Build NetworksHotspots work together to form a new global wireless network and undertake 'Proof-of-Coverage'.
