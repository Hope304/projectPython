HippiePunk album by Eylou HippiePunk Album by Eylou (sounds like Platonic love in the affair) Eylous album for free download (ZIP, 101 MB) HippiePunk from Eylou ***?: What does that mean here?Hiho, I am Eylou and wanted to be a musician or ideally rock star.So I recorded the album up there.For this I came up with a new music genre, namely hippie punk.Sounds roughly like Platonic love when the affair.In addition, I started to scribble comics.After a while I found that the comics were much more popular than my music.I can probably also draw comics better than meet tones.So I have now completely switched to comic drawing.?: Is there new music one day?Unlikely, at least I have no plans.I always wanted to make creative stuff, but I think music was the wrong medium for me.Thanks to the comics, musicians would only be a side project.Not much would come out of it - I would not have enough time for music or enough time for comics.Sometimes you have to decide and let go in life, arrrrr!?: But that's a bit sad ... it doesn't have to be!The album up there is still for free download and apart from that there are tons of grandiose bands and musicians who sing very fantastic songs, play symphonies and compose works of art.Gives more music than each of us can ever listen to.I have great respect for all thoroughbred musicians and doubt that the music world is dependent on my somewhat stupid participation.Above all, I am now doing one thing that I am extremely happy with.With the little comic strips I can do whatever I want, lots of people have fun with it and it feels pretty perfect for me.Ok, I didn't become a rock star.If I am honest with me, it does not correspond to my personality to put myself in front of a huge audience and call: "Listen to me and look at me!".I'm too introverted for that.?: Can you be reached somehow?Yes, this is possible here (click), but you would have to write a very old-fashioned email.*** >> Download the hippie punk << (whole album, zip archive, 101 MB) Tracklist / Single download: Lantern song dead dog Lena knit, baby!Hundbrandballad Tanja's letters tumortango unison none likes me inside job love axt bonusongs: lantern song (unplugged) ham she has the wrong friend *** *** Islieb-comics data protection imprint
