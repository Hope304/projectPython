The professionalism and promptness of the team really exuberates academic excellence. AVPosted Feb 18, 2019 Great experience. The writer exceeded my expectations and I have submitted a new project with them for my business. Customer service is extremely responsive. The work they do is original, I ran the project through 4 different plagiarism checkers and they came back with less than papers I've written myself. Highly recommend working with this company and their writers.

When you use our advanced requested writer feature for your custom writing order, we work extremely hard to ensure that your writer is going to be available. We use various signals and internal data points to predict whether the writer will accept the order in the first place. For example, our writers have profile settings like vacation mode where they can mark themselves as away. We also consider the writer's current workload so they have time to complete your writing order. These are just a few of the many signals we use when deciding whether to show a writer as available - and we're improving our technology every day to make it even more reliable. As of October (2016), the requested writer acceptance rate is 90%, meaning that there is a 9/10 chance they will be available.
