At some point we’d like to create a system that could calculate a precise value based on award availability, fees, award levels and ease of accrual, but for now these valuations are based on a combination of how much TPG would pay to buy points if given the opportunity, and the overall value I could get from redeeming them.2.05¢Chase Ultimate Rewards2.0¢American Express Membership Rewards1.85¢Capital One Rewards1.8¢Citi ThankYou Points1.4¢Alaska Mileage Plan1.55*¢American AAdvantage1.5¢Avios1.41*¢Delta SkyMiles1.1¢United MileagePlus1.7¢World of Hyatt Loyalty Program0.84¢Marriott Bonvoy1.8¢Bilt Rewards See AllSign up for our daily newsletterEmail addressSign upI would like to subscribe to The Points Guy newsletters and special email promotions.
