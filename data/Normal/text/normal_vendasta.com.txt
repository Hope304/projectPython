In addition, Vendasta provides partner support to help you continually grow and innovate.” Bill B. Principal “Vendasta is an amazing company and the platform is better than any other on the market. They provide world leading training and support. Their lead generation tools are very intelligent and work to get signups for your agency. This is a company that you can trust and create a truly unique and powerful marketing agency in partnership with. The support is second to none and they do what they do with passion, focus and expertise to ensure that you succeed.” David R. “What I appreciate most about the platform is the broad choice of tools and customization. But in truth, it’s the people. SaaS is trash. Add great people to a solid platform and it turns into a solution. Vendasta account team, product specialist and executives [are] all here to support their agency clients, makes it my go-to choice.” Mathew CEO in the US “I love Vendasta because the entire software system is so streamlined. Everything is incorporated into one platform that helps agencies grow and scale. Their software platform gives your clients a portal to manage everything related to their business marketing online.” Mitchell T. Principal Consultant “The Vendasta platform helps me grow my digital marketing agency by providing everything I need to succeed, including a Partner Center, Task Manager, Vendor Center and built-in CRM (Sales & Success Center). Their online marketplace has over 200 digital solutions, allowing me to provide all of the digital tools and services that my clients will ever need. It also allows me to add my own products and services to my online store, enabling me to include up-sells and additional value-added services to my clients.” Michael K. Owner “Having a product offering that is well-rounded and possibly unique from my local competitors definitely gives me an edge. Having more tools also helps me become more confident. Highly recommend.” Justin CEO in the US “I highly recommend Vendasta to anyone operating a digital marketing agency. They help you focus on growing your business by taking over the heavy lifting of doing the detail work for you. You can stay focus on the big picture and not get bogged down in the trenches. Without them, I would never have been able to scale my business, we stayed lean but expanded our offerings.” Scott K. “Vendasta’s agency tools have allowed us to provide our clients the tools and services they need to stay on top of their online reputation and social media. We’ve gained market share from our competitors, provided our clients with the latest technology to be successful online and increased our retention of clients to over 97% after their initial contract terms.” Terry B. CEO “The main benefit is that I can run a business without a bunch of employees. Even when I am big enough to need a few employees I will still need far less than if I were to run the business without Vendasta.” Thomas F. Agency Owner FAQs What type of company is Vendasta?
