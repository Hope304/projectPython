But as the challenges associated with social media multiply—brand safety, data privacy, influencer strategy, polarity, new platform entrants and more—marketers need to isolate best practices to define and refine how they harness social media to reach an array of audiences. And at a time when creators—their definition expanding—have hitched their wagons to social media’s star in profound, attention-holding ways, understanding how these forces of nature can work for and with brands has never been more important. Come learn from the good, bad and ugly examples of what works, what doesn’t, and what you need to know now about the new era of social media. @ADWEEK #SMW Announcing Megan Thee Stallion Hailing from Houston, Megan Thee Stallion is a three-time GRAMMY-winning recording artist, philanthropist and entrepreneur.

media. I always learn something new and take these strategies back to my own work, with generally successful results! Senior Marketing Manager, Venture For America Social Media Week is a must attend event for anyone seeking to use the Social Media space as a platform to monetize their brand, product or service. The speakers are leaders who define their industry, providing real time, invaluable, up to the minute information on trends and best practices. This conference was absolutely incredible. I felt inspired about the future and invigorated to return to my job! ADWEEK’s Social Media Week took great care to meticulously deliver an event dedicated to one of the most valuable existing areas of digital marketing: the creator economy. It was both exciting and informative. Research Analyst, S&P Global Market Intelligence Absolutely the must-attend event. SMW is the pinnacle where industry leaders, networking, latest tech and companies convene. 11/10 would recommend. Joseph Dawson, Director of Social Media/Senior Strategist, Axiom Innovation Social Media Week remains my top industry conference choice. It keeps me ahead of the game in the fast-paced world of social media. The variety of speakers and topics left me feeling broadly informed and ready to form my own opinion on what's to come in our industry. Nola Morris, VP, Strategy, Denim Social #SMW brings that music festival vibe with a great lineup of speakers and for social media leaders to connect and gain further insight into the world of social media trends. I am from Canada and this conference was definitely worth the trip to #SMW and hope to attend next year! #SMW helped me look at social media from a different perspective. Instead of being just a brand we need to think like a content creator. It opened up the conversation with my team on how to approach our content. Social Media Week was such an informative and inspiring experience. The insight shared by industry experts was exceptional, and the overall learnings left me hungry to do more and be better as a social media professional for my company.
