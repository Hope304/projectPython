Visit Help Center â€º Frequently Asked Questions What is a help desk? Help desk software is a tool that serves a wide range of customer support activities. You can organize messages, give assistance, and exchange information with customers at a single point of contact (SPC). The help desk uses tickets for communication â€” that's why it's also known as ticketing system software.The data collected from tickets is a valuable source of customer information. You can analyze support stories and be well-prepared for new customer cases and issues.The help desk software generates themed reports that enable you to verify your team's performance and improve your organization's customer service strategy. How does a help desk work? A help desk system deals with support requests or emails (called tickets) from users. When users have specialized issues or need help, they send a support request through different channels like email, phone, or an online form on a website. The help desk team or software then sorts and prioritizes the tickets based on the nature and seriousness of the issue. The ticket is then assigned to the appropriate support personnel or team who work on fixing the issue. The help desk keeps track of the ticket's progress by providing updates and communicating with the user. Once the issue is resolved, the help desk gives the user a solution and closes the ticket.
