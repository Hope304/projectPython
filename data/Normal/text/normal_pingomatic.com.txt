Ping-o-Matic! Ping-O-Matic Home | Blog What is this? Ping-O-Matic is a service to update different search engines that your blog has updated. Learn more... We regularly check downstream services to make sure that they're legit and still work. So while it may appear like we have fewer services, they're the most important ones. Make sure to only ping specialized services if they're relevant to your blog, otherwise you'll cause an undue burden on them.
