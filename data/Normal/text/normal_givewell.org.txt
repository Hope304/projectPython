Is there a downside?We have a high bar for the evidence and scalability of these opportunities. This may limit the cost-effectiveness ceiling for these grants. Best forIf you want high confidence in the effectiveness of your donation, donate to the Top Charities Fund. View our top charities All Grants Fund How will my donation be used?Your donation will be granted to the highest-impact programs across all our grantmaking in global health and well-being. Some programs may be much more cost-effective than our top charities, but we may also be much more uncertain about their impact. Is there a downside?It’s riskier than our Top Charities Fund. For example, we may not have as much confidence in the evidence base or may not have the same extensive history working with the grantee. Best forIf you want the highest possible expected impact and are comfortable with higher risk, donate to the All Grants Fund.

Read more about this concept here. Our Research Process We research each program extensively before funding it, and assess what the program accomplishes with that funding. Learn about our research 1Gather independent evidenceWe look at independent studies, such as randomized controlled trials, of charity programs to understand if they achieve their goals. We also consult experts to gain practical and context-specific insights. 2Model cost-effectivenessWe build in-depth models to analyze programs’ cost-effectiveness. We refine these throughout our evaluation process, based on budgets and monitoring data, to estimate impact per dollar spent. 3Conduct interviews and site visitsWe conduct extensive interviews with staff from potential grantee organizations. We may visit them to see their work in action. 4Review budgetsWe review potential grantees' past spending and forecast their future spending to better understand their track record and expected impact. 5Ask for program dataWe ask organizations to share data so we can better understand how successful the programs have been. 6Follow up on progressWe continually assess the work, progress, and future plans of the programs we fund. We will stop funding a program if we no longer believe it meets our criteria.
