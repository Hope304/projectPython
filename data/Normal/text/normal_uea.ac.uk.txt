We’re redefining what a university is and how it can best prepare you for a future in a rapidly changing world. Discover more about studying with us UEA is a home for everyone We celebrate diverse voices and backgrounds, and we stand for equal opportunity in higher education. We’re a University of Sanctuary, where all are welcome, and we’re committed to recognising and learning from our whole community. Between the Sportspark and high-tech labs, much-loved music venues and the quieter corners of our (award-winning!) parkland, first-year undergraduates rub shoulders with world-leading climate experts, student entrepreneurs share a platform with the region's biggest brands, and emerging writers teach established authors a thing or two about the world today. Campus culture UEA's campus was designed to encourage the sharing of ideas and experiences and our interdisciplinary approach to learning is protecting the vulnerable, combating HIV, finding solutions to climate change and giving young people a platform to have their voice heard, their experience valued, their ideas brought to life. It's creative, it’s different, it’s yours. This is UEA. Our world-leading research UEA research is making real-world impact. That’s why 91 per cent of UEA research has been rated 'world-leading' or 'internationally excellent' by the Research Excellence Framework (REF2021). We’re also in the UK top 20 for research quality*. UEA is a globally significant centre of research that drives global change. We bring fresh thinking to the major challenges facing society, helping to create a better future for all. UEA’s world-leading research covers science, health and medicine, social sciences and the humanities. It addresses some of the biggest issues facing society today, from transforming the lives of children in state care to providing the global temperature records which inform international climate change policy. We also have an enduring culture of working beyond subject and geographical boundaries. We think without borders. *Times Higher Education REF2021 Analysis Latest news Search news Latest research Research The Joyce Morris Research Programme in Early Years Literacies Read more > Research Enhancing Teacher Agency with Technology Read more > Research Making a difference to foodbanks through impactful research Read more > Research Developing life story work to improve the mental health of adolescents Read more > Research Mapping the future of biodiversity Read more > Research How the other half live: the prize-winning research exploring life in protected areas in the Amazon Read more > Research How social recovery therapy is changing treatment for psychosis Read more > Research How to mend a broken heart (with stem cells) Read more > Research How we got the world talking about a royal shipwreck Read more > Widening Participation: Transparency Return © UEA.
