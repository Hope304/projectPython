App Store/Google Play User Reviews "It's great because it works like a phone game, but it's a phone game that gives you time rather than taking it away." "This is the only app I’ve ever truly loved. It's such a beautiful reminder that everything big happens with many tiny steps!" "This app is best for those who need a little visual stimulation and extra incentive to stay productive." "The thought of killing a tree, even a virtual one drastically changes how I think about work." "When I have work to do it helps me stay on task. It is fun with friends and the paid version is worth it!" "This changed my life!!! Made me work much more focused and for longer periods of time."
