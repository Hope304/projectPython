Learn More Journal of Academic Freedom The current volume investigates links between landscapes of social power and the historical development and contemporary status of academic freedom. Articles explore topics such as curricular censorship, illiberalism here and abroad, systemic erosion of shared governance, and counteracting external interference. Learn More New Episodes of AAUP Presents Check out AAUP Presents, the official podcast of the AAUP. In our latest episode, we look at member-led efforts to fight legislative interference in Texas and Ohio, specifically pushing back against bills targeting diversity equity and inclusion programs, tenure, and collective bargaining. Learn More Political Interference in Higher Ed Learn about the recent hostile legislation and political actions affecting academic freedom and faculty governance in several states. Learn More Winter 2024 Academe The winter issue of Academe takes a critical look at the "higher education data juggernaut." Articles examine the spread of corporate educational technology on campus, the quantification of learning, compliance-driven demands for institutional data, and the biases underlying the data that shape public perceptions of higher education. Learn More Resources for Union Chapters We have a wide range of resources to support our unionized chapters. Find out about education and training, including our annual Summer Institute; guidance on collective bargaining topics such as organizing tactics and contract administration; institutional financial analysis; and our contract database. Learn More AAUP Updates AAUP Files Two New Amicus Briefs Supporting Professorial Speech This week, the AAUP filed amicus briefs in two important legal cases involving the right of faculty members to teach and to speak publicly about curriculum standards and shared governance. Our briefs are a key component of our work to defend higher education for the common good, and they aim to shape the law to support academic freedom, which continues to face an unprecedented barrage of attacks. The AAUP hopes that these amicus briefs will spur the courts to issue decisions that will be favorable to the individual professors involved and that will protect the rights of faculty more broadly in the years to come. Read More AAUP Votes to Sanction New College of Florida and Spartanburg Community College The AAUP’s governing Council voted to add New College of Florida and Spartanburg Community College to the Association’s list of institutions sanctioned for substantial noncompliance with widely accepted standards of academic government. Read More AAUP Receives Mellon Grant for Academic Freedom Center The AAUP has received a grant from the Mellon Foundation to establish a Center for the Defense of Academic Freedom, with the aim of examining and confronting the recent surge of political and ideological attacks on American higher education. Read More AAUP Signs Labor Movement Call for Ceasefire We, along with other members of the American labor movement, mourn the loss of life in Israel and Palestine. We express our solidarity with all workers and our common desire for peace in Palestine and Israel, and we call on President Joe Biden and Congress to push for an immediate ceasefire and end to the siege of Gaza. Read the whole statement. Read More The Time Is Now to Resist Political Interference The AAUP released a statement today commenting on the recent US House Committee on Education and the Workforce demand for documents and information from the University of Pennsylvania on attempts to curb antisemitism. The statement calls on administrators, faculties, trustees, and all who care about higher education as a public good in a democracy to resist political interference and reaffirm their commitments to academic freedom, freedom of expression, shared governance, and institutional autonomy. Read More New Campus Free Speech FAQ New guidance is out from the AAUP and AFT to help our members navigate campus free speech and academic freedom in politically charged contexts. Read More New Resource on Political Interference After identifying four trends in political interference in higher education, a new statement on political interference suggests practical ways faculty members can counteract legislative interference and includes a sample resolution faculty members can adopt to call upon university administration to safeguard AAUP-supported principles and standards of academic freedom, tenure, and governance. Read More AAUP in the News Fri, 03/01/2024 | Chronicle of Higher Education A Proposal to Tie Tenure to Intellectual Diversity Nears Approval in Indiana "It is a blank check to fire any faculty member for any reason, at any time, regardless of tenure. I think people find that hard to believe, because it is so shocking and so radical and so un-American, but that is what the text says.” Mon, 02/26/2024 | New York Times Defending Academic Freedom on Campus Since 1915 and urgently since Oct. 7, the A.A.U.P. has advocated a robust concept of academic freedom. We have urged administrators to provide an environment in which no voices are silenced, no ideas are suppressed, and the most deeply held beliefs are subject to challenge. Fri, 02/23/2024 | The Pueblo Chieftain About 75% of CSU Pueblo faculty experience economic stress, survey finds Jonathan Rees, president of CSU Pueblo's AAUP chapter, said his hope is that the survey convinces the administration to move faculty economic concerns way up the priority list. "If we explain how bad the problem is, then maybe we won't be the last thing they worry about when they are putting together next year's budget." Wed, 02/21/2024 | Inside Higher Ed Indiana Bill Threatens Faculty Members Who Don’t Provide ‘Intellectual Diversity’ “These measures would severely constrain academic freedom,” says a joint statement by the Purdue at West Lafayette and Indiana University at Bloomington chapters of the AAUP. “The security imparted by tenure is the fundamental protection of academic freedom; its loss would make university positions in Indiana undesirable. Recruiting and retaining top faculty, who will always have alternatives, will no longer be possible.” Thu, 02/01/2024 | Los Angeles Times U.S. colleges are overusing — and underpaying — adjunct professors There is no more important place for colleges to spend their money than hiring the best instructors they can find and providing fair pay, benefits and reasonable working conditions. Thu, 02/01/2024 | MSNBC The Florida GOP’s removal of this core college course is absurd This strike at sociology is very on-brand for the Florida GOP. We know about DeSantis’ ongoing crusade to commandeer all leadership positions at New College of Florida. Elsewhere, a proverbial Florida Man (with the checkered past and absence of relevant credentials that such an identity entails) has been installed as the leader of South Florida State College. The American Association of University Professors chronicled this and other outrageous Sunshine State power grabs in a report so full of absurd details that it reads like a campus novel.
