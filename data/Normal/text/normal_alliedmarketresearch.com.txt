View All Reports Client Testimonials Thank you for all your efforts and help regarding this report. My superiors were really surprised by the level of analysis and they really like this report. I am sure that we will have more future projects together. I really had a great experience in cooperating with the AMR team (Mr. Neehal Agarwal was of great help in communicating with the team my questions/requests and solving any issues). Predrag Bojović Export Sales Advisor- IT SPV @CG Corp global To write you a feedback on the report we purchased. We found it insightful and also our client found it very useful to better understand some of the market dynamics. Moreover, we enjoyed your responsiveness and our team looks forward to work with you again in the future. Matthew Brkic Expert Principal Boston Consulting Group I have reviewed the report and find it very useful and comprehensive. We are the Technology Transfer Office from Univeristy, and the purpose of the report is to identify some key development of the technology R&D direction as well as marketing analysis. So the report will be useful to us in a broader view of the overall technology blueprint. Samuel Wong Manager (Technology Development) HKUST: World-class University in Hong Kong and Asia Our goal was successfully achieved owing to your support. Honestly, though we checked other marketing data, the provided data was not realistic based on our experience. On the other hand, your data was in line with our assumption. Besides, it was very kind of you to prepare for the company profile as well as the methodology for the analysis, Since people are not familiar with foreign marketing companies, they will feel uncomfortable with their data unless they provide enough backup data. We are very much appreciating your extended positive support. Yoshinobu Matsumura(Matsumura Consulting Office) MIKASA,inc.
