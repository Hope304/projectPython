This makes it directly compete with the Moto Edge 40 Neo in the sub-Rs 25,000 segment, which offers a clean Android experience. However, the Moto Edge 40 Neo comes with a widget in the home screen that displays apps. You also get to see preloaded apps like Facebook and LinkedIn on it. While you can remove and uninstall these, it just goes to show that the Nothing OS on the Nothing Phone 2a is much cleaner with a few essential preloaded Google apps. This essentially makes the Nothing Phone 2a the better stock Android phone. However, it misses out on a couple of things like providing a charger or a case in the box. The Moto Edge 40 Neo also comes with a more premium vegan leather back and curved display with DCI-P3 coverage. So, there's that.

I’ve already pitted Phone 2a against the […] Sagnik Das Gupta 50 mins ago2024-03-05T18:14:29+05:30 View quick summary Both the Nothing Phone 2a and POCO X6 are priced pretty under Rs. 25,000, with the former costing Rs. 1,000 more. Costing less, the POCO X6 comes with both a charger and good-quality case right in the box. Meanwhile, the Nothing Phone 2a does not come with either. The POCO X6 also comes with a 1.5K display and a 3.5mm headphone jack, whereas the Nothing Phone 2a comes with an FHD+ display and no headphone jack. However, where the Nothing Phone 2a emerges superior is in the software department. From fluid animations to a bloatware-free experience, the software experience is unbeatable in the budget. You also get solid battery backup and better cameras on the Phone 2a. So, it all comes down to whether you are willing to pay that extra money for it.

However, it comes with its own shortcomings. For starters, it comes with a plastic frame and back panel, for which it feels a tad cheap in hand. You also don't get a charger or case in the box. Keeping these things aside, the device ticks almost all the boxes and is an easy recommendation for those looking for a good budget phone.
