LEARN MORE YOU HAVE QUESTIONSWE HAVE ANSWERS Is this Legal? Yes! As a 501(c)3 non-profit, non-denominational church, our ability to ordain ministers is completely legal and once ordained, you have the legal right to officiate marriage ceremonies. This right is protected by the 1st amendment's religious freedom clause. Do I have to be “Religious”? What if I am an Atheist, etc.? Becoming a minister with the AMM does not require you to hold any particular spiritual belief. We only ask that you agree to our organization's three tenets, which are listed on our ordination application. Is this really free? What's the catch? There's no catch! This is a completely free service that we are happy to provide to our ministers. That said, please note that in some states there may be additional registration requirements beyond simply becoming a minister. In those states, you may need to order registration materials from our store. VISIT OUR FAQ GET ORDAINEDWITH AMM Become a Wedding Officiant with Our Free Online Ordination!
