As the developers of KeePassXC, we do not consider the issue a vulnerability and have filed a request for the CVE to be rejected. Additional information can be found in the discussion on GitHub. The root of the argument submitted by the CVE author is that an attacker with unfettered access to an already unlocked database could export or change the password without requiring the original credentials. Where this is true, there are numerous barriers to actually executing this attack sequence. In addition, having lost control of your computer in this manner would mean the attacker could execute any number of security compromises against your KeePassXC database, regardless of requiring credentials prior to export or credential change. At this time, we are not planning any drastic changes to the program to address this submission. We are also monitoring the request to reject/dispute this CVE on the grounds it is not actually a vulnerability in our software. Information on mitigation and other factors is included after the break.Read more… KeePassXC 2.7.5 released By Jonathan White Posted on 14 May 2023, 17:00 in Releases Today, we are releasing KeePassXC 2.7.5 with a bunch of bug fixes and performance improvements.
