I use a number of tools for this purpose. Simply Wall St. has a unique pictorial approach to quickly and effectively cut through the massive amounts of data to narrow to a select few candidates. It is very easy to track your holdings. They are also very transaparent in presenting how their results are obtained. After two week trail I have parted with my hard earned money. I expect that they will help in making better investment choices in the year ahead. WESIan K14 reviewsGreat customer service !
