The Stanford University InfoLab The Stanford InfoLab has some newly refurbished lab space, thanks to a generous gift from Google! We had a Grand Opening ceremony on November 8, 2011. You can see some of the photos here (courtesy of Rick Barber). We've created a freely-available online version of our Introduction to Databases course; check out the OpenClassroom website. Materials include video mini-lectures (with in-video quizzes) and demos, written exercises, query exercises with software instructions, and pointers to readings and resources. From October-December 2011 the course will be offered in a structured fashion to the general public free of charge, including graded assignments, graded exams, online discussions with the instructor, and a completion certificate. We participated in the Crowd Crowd meetup, held at UC Berkeley in June 2011. We shared ideas and had fun discussions about the intersection of crowdsourcing and data management. We participated in the first NorCal Database Day, held at UC Davis on April 1, 2011. Many current and former members of our group attended CIDR 2011. Here is a photo from the conference: (Alumni and friends include: (front) Shel Finkelstein, H V Jagadish, Sergey Melnik, Surajit Chaudhuri, Ander de Keijzer, Donald Kossmann, Jun Yang; (back) Tyson Condie, Alkis Simitsis, Chris Olston, Hank Korth, Susan Davidson, Jeff Naughton, Alon Halevy, Yannis Papakonstantinou) Top 20 hits on infolab.stanford.edu over the past week Useful Resources Directions to the Gates Computer Science Building InfoBlog (currently dormant) Problems with this page?
