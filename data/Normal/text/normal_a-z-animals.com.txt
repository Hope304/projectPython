Animals that are considered mammals include warm-blooded vertebrates that have hair or fur and whose babies drink milk. Unlike other animal types like birds and insects, all mammal babies drink milk that comes from their mother’s bodies. This is one of the key ways to know if an animal is a mammal.See the complete list of mammals. Reptiles Lizards, dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, and snakes – all belong to that ancient and stout class of animals known as the reptiles. This is a diverse group with more than 10,000 different species and a huge representation in the fossil record. Once the dominant land vertebrates on the planet, reptiles still occupy just about every single ecosystem outside of the extreme north and south.See the complete list of reptiles. Fish Fish are aquatic vertebrates. They usually have gills, paired fins, a long body covered with scales, and tend to be cold-blooded. “Fish” is a term used to refer to lampreys, sharks, coelacanths and ray-finned fishes, but is not a taxonomic group, which is a clade or group containing a common ancestor and all its descendants.See the complete list of fish. Birds Birds, members of the class Aves, include more than 10,400 living species. Their feathers distinguish them from all other classes of animal; no other animals on earth have them. If you see an animal with feathers, it’s undoubtedly a bird. Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded vertebrates with four-chambered hearts. However, they are more closely related to reptiles and are believed to have evolved from dinosaurs.See the complete list of birds. Amphibians The official class of amphibians is Amphibia. To have the classification of an amphibian, an animal must be a vertebrate, require water to survive, be cold-blooded, and spend time both on land and in water. Though other animals only live on land or in the water, amphibians have the unique ability to thrive equally in both. Amphibians cover over 6,000 different species across the globe, but about 90% are frogs.See the complete list of amphibians. Invertebrates The definition of an invertebrate is any animal that does not have a backbone or vertebral column. The most prolific and easily recognizable members of the invertebrate family are insects. It’s estimated that upwards of 30 million individual species of invertebrates may exist accounting for between 90-95 percent of all organisms on the planet.See the complete list of invertebrates. Insects All insects are part of the taxonomical phylum Arthropoda, and they are collectively referred to as arthropods. It is common to see this name misspelled as “anthropod,” but this is not the correct term. They can be found in nearly every environment on the planet, and they currently account for over half of all known living organisms in the world. They have undergone many cycles of evolution depending on the resources available to them.See the complete list of insects.Explore Types of Wild Animals from Around the WorldWe track thousands of animals from every continent and corner on earth, and are adding more every day!African Animals – Africa is home to some of the most incredible and dangerous animals in the world.Asian Animals – Asia has the world’s longest coastline, and an amazing diversity of exotic animals, birds, and more.Central American Animals – Discover the the nearly 400 different animals we track in Central America today.Eurasian Animals – Eurasia has some of the rarest animals in the world, like Siberian Tigers and Snow Leopards.European Animals – We track over 500 different animals in Europe, including wolves and bears.North American Animals – North America has many beautiful national parks that house some of the rarest animals on earth.Marine (Ocean) Animals – The ocean is teaming with life, from the smallest shrimp to the largest animal ever – the Blue Whale!Oceanian Animals – Oceania has many islands, and the world’s highest concentration of marsupials.South American Animals – Home to the stealthy Jaguar, the friendly Capybara, and many more!See Endangered and Extinct Animals ListsA-Z Animals follow’s the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species definitions of threatened and endangered animals.
