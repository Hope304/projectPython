What's more important, these wireframes are intuitive and easy to understand-- even for non-technical people. – Max Kostinevich Spent a terrific week designing and building both desktop and mobile mock-ups in Balsamiq, I forgot how fun it is to take a step back from all the hi-fidelity stuff and to work on a project where they do things right from the beginning. – Franka Baly Interesting observation from interviewing a lot of product managers - the ones who use a wireframing tool like Balsamiq end up doing much better than ones who use prototyping tools like Figma, because the former allows for focusing purely on the concept rather than visuals! – Aditya Rajgarhia Balsamiq helps your ideas stand on their own.
