I find Andrew both listens well to my concerns and anticipates issues I may not. Highly recommend. David Millstone Dave Fish is the absolute best. He is an excellent attorney who is both skilled at his practice and attentive at listening to his clients' wishes and needs. He is also extremely personable and kind. I highly recommend his services. Erin Bauwens Very happy with the meticulous advice and client focus of Robert and Danielle. They went above and beyond. They assisted us to establish several companies under very tight timeframes, with the team making themselves available late at night and on the weekends to get the job done. Having only recently moved to the US, the legal process was very opaque to us but they took the time to step us through all of the relevant steps and considerations to make sure we felt comfortable. Max Gwynn Romano Law has been a great asset to our business. Prompt, punctual and willing to work with and guide us through our less than orthodox business needs. We greatly appreciate this relationship Amit Jagwani Romano Law was very specific and made certain that they were looking out for my best interest. He went through the contract and made me aware of what was critical important. There team are amazing and I am looking forward to working with them in the future. I needed a law firm that is direct, to the point and aggressive when advocating for what I need. They did a great job. Amazing!!!
