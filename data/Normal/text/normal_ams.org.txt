Join us today » Research News Events Deadlines From Notices of the AMS The Contributions of Chuu-Lian Terng to Geometry by Karen Uhlenbeck Communicated by Chikako Mese Introduction Chuu-Lian Terng is a geometer who has made important contributions to both submanifold geometry and integrable systems. My collaboration with her over many years has been rewarding and profitable. This article is an attempt to share my appreciation of her work with a wide audience. I am indebted to her for decades of profitable collaboration, a warm personal relationship and help with writing this article. The article is incomplete, as space constraints do not allow me to discuss all of her research. I chose to emphasize personal details and her work on integrable systems. Many schools of mathematics contributed to the development of integrable systems and I cannot include them all. The outline given in Section 6 is as I have come to see the subject. This is close, but not identical to Terng's view, and will differ from other views. I hope to give a window opening onto her work, not to provide a definitive treatise. The ideas belong to many people and errors are mine. The reader will surely join me in thanking the referees for helpful comments and important corrections.
