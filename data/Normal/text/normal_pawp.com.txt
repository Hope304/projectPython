Saved my best friend's life. Thank you so much Pawp!"My 11 year old Papillon was rowdy and hyper until she wasn't. I noticed her tongue was blue and she was crying. After consulting the Pawp DVM, I followed the advice and ran to the ER immediately. She could have died had I waited. I cannot describe how grateful I am for their patience and life-saving advice. Worth every penny. Customer forever."Kim G.Toledo, OH I was skeptical but they saved me so many trips to the vet!"Honestly, I was skeptical at first but my goodness has this company come in clutch on late nights when I am panicking. So many evenings I have talked to a vet that has calmed me down and avoided an unnecessary trip the emergency vet. These guys are amazing and being able to have a safety net available if needed is truly a blessing. Truly helped me out a ton."Shannon W.Toledo, OH I love having Pawp in my pocket for peace of mind!"Having a second opinion from a team of knowledgeable pet people is wonderful. You can message, video call, or call them as many times as you see fit with one steady cost. My pup means the world to me and I love having the comfort of Pawp advice on everything from bumps on her body from bugs to the big stuff."Margaret R.San Francisco, CA How We TreatA science-backed approach to pet care.Most health issues aren't solved in one visit.
