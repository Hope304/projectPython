The CyberCemetery is an archive of government websites that have ceased operation (usually websites of defunct government agencies and commissions that have issued a final report). This collection features a variety of topics indicative of the broad nature of government information. In particular, this collection features websites that cover topics supporting the universityâ€™s curriculum and particular program strengths. Who created and maintains the CyberCemetery? The University of North Texas Libraries and the U.S. Government Printing Office, as part of the Federal Depository Library Program, created a partnership to provide permanent public access to the Web sites and publications of defunct U.S. government agencies and commissions. This collection was named the "CyberCemetery" by early users of the site. This collection supports the mission of the UNT Libraries by acquiring, preserving, and providing access to recorded knowledge in the form of government websites.
