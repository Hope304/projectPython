Welcome Orthoptera from anywhere in the world! Some 30,000 species. The folks at Naturalis, in particular Ruud Altenburg, Marijn Prins, Judith Slaa, Karim Khanipour and Daphne Duin, have helped us enormously to get it all done. Without financial help of NLBIF and the Orthopterists' Society we wouldn't even have started.

Baudewijn was very much at the start of this, together with Roy Kleukers. Thanks guys!! What is xeno-canto? xeno-canto is a website dedicated to sharing wildlife sounds from all over the world.
