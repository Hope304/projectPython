Achieving Universal Coverage The United States is the only wealthy nation in which a large proportion of people lack health insurance coverage. We should all be able to get and afford the health care we need, when we need it. We track U.S. progress toward that goal nationally and by state. Learn More right-thin-arrow icon Controlling Health Care Costs The United States spends more per person on health care than any other wealthy nation, and so do American families. How can we ensure that health care is affordable for individuals, families, and government? Learn More right-thin-arrow icon Advancing Health Equity Our nation’s legacy of racism is embedded in our health care system. For many people of color, this legacy has meant less access to quality care and poorer health outcomes. We research and promote the policies and practices needed to achieve an antiracist health system that helps people of color to thrive.
