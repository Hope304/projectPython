Twenty-two journalists have been kidnapped; most are still being held. This is not limited to Ukrainians alone. U.S. journalists covering the war are the targets of Russian hackers, including those based in the United States. That is why the SPJ Foundation is creating the Ukraine Journalists Fund, a tax-exempt fund with 100% of the money going to helping local Ukrainian journalists continue to do their jobs.
