xkcd – The blag of the webcomic Skip to content xkcd The blag of the webcomic What If 2 I’m excited to announce that I’m publishing a What If? sequel! What If? 2: Additional Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions will be in stores 9/13, and is available for preorder now! In What If 2, I answer new questions I’ve receieved in the years since What If? was released. People have asked about touching exotic materials, traveling across space and time, eating things they shouldn’t, and smashing large objects into the Earth. There are questions about lasers, explosions, swingsets, candy, and soup. Several planets are destroyed—one of them by the soup. Like What If?, What If? 2 also features collections of short answers, new lists of weird and worrying questions, and some of my favorite answers from the What If site. If you want to get it when it’s released, you can preorder a copy! Posted byRandall2022-01-31Posted inUncategorized Book tour wrap-up Thank you to everyone who came to events on my book tour! It was a wild ride visiting so many cities in short succession. Thank you so much to the booksellers, venues, and especially to the wonderful people who co-hosted the tour events with me: Kate Darling, Alexandra Petri, Lev Grossman, Jim Ottaviani, Ken Jennings, Adam Savage, Ariel Waldman, Cory Doctorow, Kyle Hill, Bill Amend, Dean Regas, Sean Cannon, and Katie Mack. In addition to the above, I got to meet so many other cool people during the tour, including Simone Giertz, Scott Manley, and lots of researchers, engineers, science-enthusiast kids, and other people working on all kinds of neat stuff. And thank you to everyone who waited an extra 5 minutes to get a book signed because there was a seismologist in line and I couldn’t stop myself from asking them a bunch of questions about earthquakes. A picture from my conversation with writer Alexandra Petri in Washington, DC If you weren’t able to make it to any of my tour events, How To is now available everywhere, including at Barnes and Noble, Target, Amazon, local independents, and more. Some Barnes and Noble locations and indies have special signed copies, so you can check with your bookseller to see if those are available. Posted byRandall2019-09-252019-09-26Posted inUncategorized How to Send a File My new book, How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems, comes out in a week! You can preorder it now on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, IndieBound, and Apple Books. Here’s an excerpt from the How To chapter on file transfers. Chapter 19: How to Send a File Sending large data files can be difficult. Modern software systems have moved away from the concept of “files.” They don’t show you a folder full of image files; they show you a collection of photos. But files linger on, and will probably continue to do so for decades to come. And as long as we have files, we’ll need to send them to people. The simplest, most obvious way to send a file is to pick up the device the file is stored on, walk over to the intended recipient, and hand it to them. Carrying computers can be difficult — especially the earlier ones that were the size of a whole room — so rather than carry the whole computer, you can try detaching a piece of the computer containing the file. You can then bring this piece to the other person and let them transfer it to their own device. On a desktop-style computer, the files may be stored on a hard drive, which can often be removed without destroying the computer. On some devices, though, file storage is permanently attached to the electronics, making removal more challenging. A more convenient and less destructive solution is removable storage. You can make a copy of the file, put it on a device, then give the device to the person. Carrying storage devices around is a surprisingly high-bandwidth way to transfer information. A suitcase full of MicroSD cards contains many petabytes of data; if you want to transfer very large amounts of data, mailing boxes of disk drives will almost always be faster than transferring them over the internet. If you want to send data to a specific location that’s too far to walk, but not convenient to reach by mail — say, a nearby mountaintop — you could try using some kind of autonomous vehicle to carry it. A delivery drone, for example, could easily carry a small satchel of SD cards containing terabytes of data. Quadcopter-style drones don’t work very well over long distances thanks to the limitations of batteries. If a drone has to carry its own battery, it can only hover for so long. If it wants to hover longer, it needs to carry a bigger battery, but that means more weight and faster power consumption. For the same reason that a house supported by jet engines [Note: For more on hovering houses, see Chapter 7: How to Move] can only hover for a few hours, small coaster-size drones typically have flight times measured in minutes, and the larger ones used for photography are usually limited to less than an hour in the air. Even if it flew very fast, a tiny drone carrying a MicroSD card could make it just a few miles before running out of steam. You could increase your range by making the drone bigger, adding solar panels, flying higher, and going faster. Or you could turn to the real masters of efficient long-distance flight: Butterflies. Monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles during their migration across North America, with some traveling all the way from Canada to Mexico in a single season. If you look up during the spring or fall on the East Coast of the United States, you can sometimes spot them gliding by silently overhead, a few hundred feet above the ground. Their extreme range puts drones — and even many large aircraft — to shame. You might think butterflies have an unfair advantage over battery-powered aerial vehicles, since they can stop to consume nectar and “recharge.” Butterflies will certainly refuel if they can, but they don’t necessarily need to. Another butterfly species, the painted lady (Vanessa cardui), is even more impressive: it flies from Europe to central Africa, a 4,000-kilometer flight that takes it over the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara desert. Butterflies make these journeys powered only by small reserves of stored lipids. They can fly so much more efficiently than drones in part by soaring — they seek out thermal columns and mountain waves, then hold their wings steady and ride the rising air upward like a vulture, hawk, or eagle. If you want to send your file to someone who lives along the migration route, could you get a butterfly to carry it for you? Butterflies can carry weights. Volunteers with groups like Monarch Watch tag tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of monarch butterflies each year to track their migration and monitor their population (which has been in decline in recent decades). The smaller tags weigh about a milligram, but monarchs have completed their migration with larger tags that weigh 10 mg or more. MicroSD cards weigh several hundred milligrams — comparable to the weight of a butterfly — so butterflies would have a hard time carrying them. But there’s no reason a storage device can’t be made smaller. MicroSD cards contain memory chips, and the storage density of these chips might be up to a gigabyte per square millimeter. Given those sizes, a butterfly could easily carry a tiny chip with a gigabyte of data. If your file is larger than that, you could break it up across multiple butterflies, and send multiple copies for redundancy. When your data finally arrived at its destination, the recipient would have to check a lot of butterflies to assemble all the pieces of the file. You may need to develop some kind of touchless butterfly scanner that allows them to scan many butterflies at once. You could avoid that problem — and increase your bandwidth dramatically — by using DNA-based storage. Researchers have stored data by encoding it into a DNA sample, then sequencing the DNA to recover it. Systems like this can achieve densities far beyond anything we do with chips — it’s possible to store and recover hundreds of petabytes of data using a single gram of DNA. Each year, tens to hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies arrive in Mexico to spend the winter together in giant colonies in the mountains. If you tagged ten million of these butterflies with tiny pouches containing 5 mg of DNA storage each, the total capacity of the butterfly armada would be about 10 zettabytes — 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes. That’s roughly the total amount of digital data in existence in the late 2010s. If the Sun is warm, the winds are favorable, and it’s the right time of year, you could use butterflies to send someone the entire internet. How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems will be released on September 3rd. You can preorder it now on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, IndieBound, and Apple Books. Posted byRandall2019-08-26Posted inUncategorized Book tour and contest winner The winner We got a huge number of submissions to the How To book tour challenge, and I’m delighted to announce the winner: The How To book tour will be taking me to Juneau, Alaska, thanks to an entry from Juneau’s Mendenhall Valley Public Library. The 98-person entry was submitted in a series of four amazing YouTube videos: Video 1 / Video 2 / Video 3 / Video 4. I’m a sucker for (a) public libraries, and (b) people who get so excited about glaciers that they lose their train of thought. Runners-up There were countless fantastic entries, a just few of which I want to highlight here. The Content Bookstore in Northfield, MN organized over 60 patrons into a choose-your-own-adventure story. The Sacramento Public Library hosted an enormous collection of stories, including one which appears to confess to a bank robbery: This is Me Robin The Bank Because I’m Feeling Lucky. What If…20/20 Hindsight, I Might Regret This Confession. Ha! I Regret Nothing. Benton Lowey-Ball of Neptune Beach, Florida wrote and self-published a book, A Shameless Attempt at Convincing Randall Munroe to put Neptune Beach, Florida on his Book Tour: A tale of Necromancers and Skydiving, specifically for this challenge. And Naitian Zhou of Ann Arbor, Michigan built an interactive tool that can generate arbitrary grammatical sentences using Python language tools and a database of book titles. We’ll be reaching out to the runners-up to send them a signed book or a personalized drawing of their bookstore or library. Thank you so much to everyone who participated! Tour updates The How To book tour starts on September 3rd in Cambridge. I’ll be appearing in conversation with some very cool people, including researchers, journalists, and cartoonists. We’ll be discussing How To, science, comics, the destruction of the universe, and the ethics of hitting drones with tennis balls.

Posted byRandall2019-08-232019-08-27Posted inUncategorized Serena Versus the Drones My new book, How To, comes out on September 3rd (preorder: Amazon, Barnes & Noble, IndieBound, and Apple Books). One of the most exciting things about writing How To was that, for a few chapters, I was able to reach out to some extremely cool people who were willing to apply their unique expertise to ridiculous tasks. Among those who generously agreed to help was Serena Williams. Here’s a portion of the chapter “How to Catch a Drone”, in which Serena helped test whether tennis serves could be an effective countermeasure against flying robots … by taking a drone out onto a court and hitting tennis balls at it until it crashed. How to Catch a Drone A wedding-photography drone is buzzing around above you. You don’t know what it’s doing there and you want it to stop. Let’s suppose you have a garage full of sports equipment— baseballs, tennis rackets, lawn darts, you name it. Which sport’s projectiles would work best for hitting a drone? And who would make the best anti-drone guard? A baseball pitcher? A basketball player? A tennis player? A golfer? Someone else? There are a few factors to consider — accuracy, weight, range, and projectile size. One sport I couldn’t find good data on was tennis. I found some studies of tennis pro accuracy, but they involved hitting targets marked on the court, rather than in the air. So I reached out to Serena Williams. To my pleasant surprise, she was happy to help out. Her husband, Alexis, offered a sacrificial drone, a DJI Mavic Pro 2 with a broken camera. They headed out to her practice court to see how effective the world’s best tennis player would be at fending off a robot invasion. The few studies I could find suggested tennis players would score relatively low com- pared to athletes who threw projectiles— more like kickers than pitchers. My tentative guess was that a champion player would have an accuracy ratio around 50 when serving, and take 5–7 tries to hit a drone from 40 feet. (Would a tennis ball even knock down a drone? Maybe it would just ricochet off and cause the drone to wobble! I had so many questions.) Alexis flew the drone over the net and hovered there, while Serena served from the baseline. Her first serve went low. The second zipped past the drone to one side. The third serve scored a direct hit on one of the propellers. The drone spun, momentarily seemed like it might stay in the air, then flipped over and smashed into the court. Serena started laughing as Alexis walked over to investigate the crash site, where the drone lay on the court near several propeller fragments. I had expected a tennis pro would be able to hit the drone in five to seven tries; she got it in three. For more on anti-drone strategies, sports projectile accuracy, a discussion with a robot ethicist about whether hitting a drone with a tennis ball is wrong, and many other topics, check out How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems, available September 3rd (preorder: Amazon, Barnes & Noble, IndieBound, and Apple Books).

Introduction This is a book of bad ideas. At least, most of them are bad ideas. It’s possible some good ones slipped through the cracks. If so, I apologize. Some ideas that sound ridiculous turn out to be revolutionary. Smearing mold on an infected cut sounds like a terrible idea, but the discovery of penicillin showed that it could be a miracle cure. On the other hand, the world is full of disgusting stuff that you could smear on a wound, and most of them won’t make it better. Not all ridiculous ideas are good. So how do we tell the good ideas from the bad? We can try them and see what happens. But sometimes, we can use math, research, and things we already know to work out what will happen if we do. When NASA was planning to send its car-size Curiosity rover to Mars, they had to figure out how to land it gently on the surface. Previous rovers had landed using parachutes and air bags, so NASA engineers considered this approach with Curiosity, but the rover was too large and heavy for parachutes to slow it down enough in Mars’s thin atmosphere. They also thought about mounting rockets on the rover to let it hover and touch down gently, but the exhaust would create dust clouds that would obscure the surface and make it hard to land safely. Eventually, they came up with the idea of a “sky crane” —a vehicle that would hover high above the surface using rockets while lowering Curiosity to the ground on a long tether. This sounded like a ridiculous idea, but every other idea they could come up with was worse. The more they looked at the sky crane idea, the more plausible it seemed. So they tried it, and it worked. We all start out life not knowing how to do things. If we’re lucky, when we need to do something, we can find someone to show us how. But sometimes, we have to come up with a way to do it ourselves. This means thinking of ideas and then trying to decide whether they’re good or not. This book explores unusual approaches to common tasks, and looks at what would happen to you if you tried them. Figuring out why they would or wouldn’t work can be fun and informative and sometimes lead you to surprising places. Maybe an idea is bad, but figuring out exactly why it’s a bad idea can teach you a lot—and might help you think of a better approach. And even if you already know the right way to do all these things, it can be helpful to try to look at the world through the eyes of someone who doesn’t. After all, for anything that “everyone knows” by the time they reach adulthood, every day over 10,000 people in the United States alone are learning it for the first time. That’s why I don’t like making fun of people for admitting they don’t know something or never learned how to do something. Because if you do that, all it does is teach them not to tell you when they’re learning something . . . and you miss out on the fun. This book may not teach you how to throw a ball, how to ski, or how to move. But I hope you learn something from it. If you do, you’re one of today’s lucky 10,000.

It’s titled How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems, and it’s an extremely unhelpful guide to solving everyday problems. How To is an instruction manual for taking everyday problems and using science and creative thinking to turn them into much bigger and more exciting problems. It teaches you how to cross a river by boiling it, outlines some of the many uses for lava around the home, and walks you through how to use experimental military research to ensure that your friends will never again ask you to help them move. From changing a lightbulb to throwing a pool party, it describes unusual ways to accomplish common tasks, and analyzes what would happen to you if you tried them. In addition to being a profoundly unhelpful self-help book, it’s an exercise in applying math, science, and research to ordinary problems, and a tour through some of the strange and fun science underlying the world around us. How To will be released on September 3rd, but you can preorder it now from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, Indie Bound, and Apple Books. For more, you can check out my Q&A with Entertainment Weekly about the book, and you can find details about foreign editions at xkcd.com/how-to.
