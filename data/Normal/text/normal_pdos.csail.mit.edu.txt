MIT CSAIL Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems Group Publications Research projects People Software We at PDOS build and investigate software systems for parallel and distributed environments, and have conducted research in systems verification, operating systems, multi-core scalability, security, networking, mobile computing, language and compiler design, and systems architecture. PDOS builds high-performance, reliable, and working systems. We are part of MIT CSAIL. See our publications for more details about our research. We work concurrently on a number of research projects. Our currently active research projects can be roughly grouped into the following categories. Verified hardware/software systems Proving hardware security modules (HSMs) correct and secure. Verifying transactional database systems Verifying practical and high-performance transactional database systems. Perennial: verifying concurrent storage systems Verifying crash-safe, concurrent systems using Iris and Coq. See also the related Systems Security Group.
