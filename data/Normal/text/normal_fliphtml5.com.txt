Marianne A Principal and Design Director As a marketing agency that creates print and digital communications, FlipHTML5 makes it easy for us to display examples of the annual reports, catalogs, books, Bibles, and print publications in our case studies and on our client's websites. It's the most flexible and comprehensive solution we found. Marianne A Principal and Design Director Brian S President We're able to deliver an internal publication to our organization in a more engaging way. The interface is easy to use and intuitive, even for a beginner. I'm able to upload large files in minutes and publish the document in a way that is more engaging for our readers. They also have excellent customer service. Brian S President Alex P Development Coordinator I've been using it for quite a few years now. I have tried a few others and they didn't have the functionality for FlipHTML5. The end results elevate a simple brochure into the look of a published magazine! It's so more engaging than scrolling through a PDF. I also appreciate that we can link to our website right from the document. Alex P Development Coordinator Convert your PDF to flipbook today!
