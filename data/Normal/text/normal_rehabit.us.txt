Without FEELING the reality deep within your sub-conscious mind, it's like throwing seeds on a barren land. Why Do Most Affirmations Leave You Feeling Empty?Many affirmations are generic and lack depth, failing to strike a chord with your true desires and experiences. They're like a one-size-fits-all garment that doesn't quite fit anyone perfectly. Generic Affirmations: Do They Really Speak to You?Most affirmations are created for the masses. They might sound good, but they don’t necessarily resonate with your unique journey, challenges, and dreams. It's like using someone else's map for your personal expedition.
