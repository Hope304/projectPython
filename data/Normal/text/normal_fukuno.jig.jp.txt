Gray and Scott K. Scott.If you can operate these with XY on the screen, it looks like a life game!The open source found on GitHub was based on "AADEBDEB/WebGL_GRASCOTTT_REACTIONDIFFFUSION_SIMULATION: Gray-Scott Reaction Diffusion Diffusion Simulation in WebGL".The developer is AadeBdeb, the same as the one who used it as a remodeled life game!"Gray-Scott Reaction Diffusion Simulation in WebGL" SRC ON GitHub This kind of process is a good technique for parallel computing using GPU!Let's explore the supply (Feed), removal (kill), and subtle balance!If it is annihilated, retry with RESET or space key!"Code4fukui/WebGL_GRAYSCOTT_REACTIONDIFFUSION_SIMULATION: Gray-Scott Diffusion Simulation In WebGL" is compact, so it looks good for WebGL/GLSL.GUI library, Dat.gui is changed to Lil-Gui and frame rate check library stats.js to use the ES module version.Import {Gui} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/lil-gui@0.16.1/dist/lil-gui.esm.min.js"; Import Stats from "https: //mrdoob.githu b.io/stats.js/build/stats.module.js "; CC by 4.0 Taisuke Fukuno (Data with electronic signature)/@taisukeF/Previous blog << >> Next blog open source fluid art 2024-03-02 #js #glsl #Art (fluid simulation found in #art X.An application unique to GPU, a computer that operates in parallel.Based on the open source "WebGL Fluid Simulation" searched and found in "Fluid WebGL", the GUI has been remodeled by changing the GUI from Dat.gui to Lil-Gui compatible with ES modules."FORKED WebGL Fluid Simulation" SRC ON GitHub automatically sells random repeat mode!"FORKED WEBGL FLUID SIMULATION" SRC ON GitHub GUI can play with various settings.A full screen mode switching button is added to the bottom!Let's ENJOY GPU Art!
