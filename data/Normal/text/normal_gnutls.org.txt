GnuTLS The GnuTLS Transport Layer Security Library Overview News Download Help/Bugs Development (gitlab) Documentation Security advisories Authors Welcome to GnuTLS project pages Overview GnuTLS is a secure communications library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols and technologies around them. It provides a simple C language application programming interface (API) to access the secure communications protocols as well as APIs to parse and write X.509, PKCS #12, and other required structures. The project strives to provide a secure communications back-end, simple to use and integrated with the rest of the base Linux libraries. A back-end designed to work and be secure out of the box, keeping the complexity of TLS and PKI out of application code. Features Support for TLS 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, 1.0 protocols, and (optionally) SSL 3.0 Support for DTLS 1.2, and DTLS 1.0, protocols Support for certificate path validation, as well as DANE and trust on first use. Support for the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). Support for public key methods, including RSA and Elliptic curves, as well as password and key authentication methods such as SRP and PSK protocols. Support for all the strong encryption algorithms, including AES and Camellia. Support for CPU-assisted cryptography with VIA padlock and AES-NI instruction sets. Support for cryptographic accelerator drivers via /dev/crypto. Supports natively HSMs and cryptographic tokens, via PKCS #11 and the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Runs on most Unix platforms and Windows. License The core library licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 (LGPLv2.1+). The LGPL license is compatible with a wide range of free licenses, and even permit you to use GnuTLS in non-free proprietary programs.
