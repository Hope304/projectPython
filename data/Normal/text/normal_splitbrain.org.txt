One year of falling in love.… ▶DKIM-Konfiguration für Postfixboardgame.io - Open-Source Game Engine for Turn-Based GamesBoardzilla — A boardgame development frameworkMICO Toastie About 8 years ago I blogged about Toastabags - simple bags that allow you to make grilled cheese sandwiches in a Toaster. I still love them, I still use them. But recently I stumbled about a thing in this YouTube video: Ashens and Barry are using a… ▶Soldering Station Box For decades I used a very cheap soldering iron without any temperature control. When it was time to replace it, I went for a TS80 - a tiny soldering iron powered by USB-C. It was great, but the display died after just a few uses. So I replaced it with a… ▶Hixie's Natural Log: Reflecting on 18 years at GoogleGithub repo Authress-Engineering/openapi-explorerEnd of Year Wood Working The year is nearly over, time to quickly post about the three last wood working projects.

That was relatively easy using the the Growatt integration available. This integration was… ▶Tonie Unicorn Shelf A few weeks ago, Kaddi and I finished building a Tonie shelf. Tonies? So, what are Tonies? If you're around my age you probably grew up with a cassette player and various children's tapes. They were relatively cheap and kept the kids occupied for an hour or so. Even young children quickly learned how to use cassette tapes and players.… ▶A brief explainer of sexual dimorphismGithub repo ricklamers/shell-aiGithub repo andreknieriem/simplelightboxGithub repo owulveryck/goMarkableStreamGithub repo fandau1/ESP32-leafUsing SQLite as Vector Store in PHP At work, I'm working on a plugin for DokuWiki that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to answer questions by referencing the wiki pages.
