The OpenBSD project produces a FREE, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our efforts emphasize portability, standardization, correctness, proactive security and integrated cryptography. As an example of the effect OpenBSD has, the popular OpenSSH software comes from OpenBSD. OpenBSD is freely available from our download sites. The current release is OpenBSD 7.4, released October 16, 2023. This is the 55th release. OpenBSD is developed entirely by volunteers. The project's development environment and developer events are funded through contributions collected by The OpenBSD Foundation. Contributions ensure that OpenBSD will remain a vibrant and free operating system. Associated projects: OpenSSH, OpenBGPD, rpki-client, OpenNTPD, OpenSMTPD, OpenIKED, mandoc, LibreSSL
