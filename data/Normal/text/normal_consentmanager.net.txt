We will save the visitor‚Äôs decision and make it accessible to your advertisers and their other partners so that they know whether/how they may process personal data.Why is CCPA compliance important in consentmanager?Most websites and apps work with applications that fall under the scope of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This already includes the services from Google. A consideration of corresponding legal requirements is therefore essential in the Borlabs alternative from consentmanager.What happens if consent is refused?If a visitor does not agree to the collection and use of cookies, no corresponding cookies can be collected or data created. This applies in particular to tracking data that provides information about user behavior. Such data offers business site operators in particular important clues for optimizing the website. You therefore benefit from legally secure consent via consentmanager.When is consent to the use of cookies important?Cookie consent is generally required as soon as technically non-essential cookies are to be used on a page. This begins with the use of simple tracking and analysis tools. These always work with tracking cookies. They are very important for business websites and shops because they provide information about user behavior. With the consentmanager cookie banner, users have the option of legally secure consent.What is required for the legally effective cookie consent?With consentmanager‚Äôs Borlabs Cookie Alternative, you have a powerful solution for asking for consent from your users to use cookies. The cookie notice is automatically displayed when you visit the website. It reappears every time you visit your site. Visitors are informed about the use of cookies and have the option to accept or reject them. This enables GDPR-compliant consent via a double opt-in.What is Cookie Consent?Cookie consent is the consent of your visitors to the processing of certain cookies. Since the ECJ ruling on cookies, this consent must be explicit and voluntary. Non-essential cookies may only be set after consent has been given. Cookies that are strictly necessary for the operation of the website are excluded from this rule. Please note that we cannot provide legal advice. Some points of this FAQ may also change over time or be interpreted differently by courts. That‚Äôs why you should always consult your lawyer!
