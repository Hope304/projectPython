H.S.Irwin & Barneby observed in Manaus, Brazil by crax (CC BY-NC 4.0) Climate change Peer-reviewed papers using data Biodiversity loss and climate change interact in many ways, reflecting two sides of the same problem: humanity‚Äôs unsustainable relationship with the natural world. Explore the research relying on data from the GBIF network to understand and assess the growing impact that changing temperatures, precipitation and other climate-related phenomena are having on biodiversity. Featured See all Sphagneticola trilobata (L.) Pruski observed in Macao by Jeremy J Busfield (CC BY-NC 4.0) Invasive alien species peer-reviewed papers using data Information is the single most important variable necessary to support research, monitoring and management of alien and invasive species. From identifying and predicting potential invasions to improving management applications, detection strategies, and risk assessments, GBIF plays a pivotal role in fulfilling data needs about these costly and disruptive forces of change. Featured See all Rhinolophus pusillus Temminck, 1834 observed in Shizuoka, Japan by Ryosuke Kuwahara (CC BY-NC 4.0) Human health Peer-reviewed papers using data Knowing where the species that transmit disease-causing pathogens occur is important for recognizing, managing and preventing potential threats to human communities. Data shared through the GBIF network enables scientists and researchers to map the wild host, vector and reservoir species involved in cycles of disease transmission and how their distributions are changing. Featured See all Danaus plexippus subsp. plexippus observed in Quer√©taro, Mexico by Christine Cieslak Campelo (CC BY-NC 4.0) IUCN Red List of Threatened Species‚Ñ¢ species assessments citing GBIF GBIF-mediated data is used for mapping species distributions and for calculating Area of Occupancy (AOO) and Extent of Occurrence, measures key to assessing threat level and categorizing species on the Red List.
