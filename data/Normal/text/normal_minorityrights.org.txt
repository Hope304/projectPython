We work with minorities and indigenous peoples in defence of their rights. Empowering Voices: Advocating for indigenous people with disabilities worldwide Criminalizing blasphemy: Implications for Egypt’s religious minorities Amazigh New Year in Morocco: a milestone for indigenous rights? If Morocco is serious about recognizing the Amazigh culture in more than name only, it must follow the path already laid out by the tireless activists and organizations advocating for language justice, land rights, and equitable socio-economic development. For the love of languages: Meeting on minority tongues in Türkiye With many of the diverse languages in Türkiye being endangered, some severely, time is of the essence. In the absence of meaningful state support at present, and little expectation of positive change at the government level in the immediate future, participants resolved to redouble efforts at the community level to ensure a new generation of speakers of all the languages currently spoken in Türkiye. The Malparara Way: Reflections from South Australia on Mother Language Day As we celebrate international mother tongue day, we should acknowledge and support the past, present and future role of educators in nurturing young generations of indigenous language-speakers, while remembering the painful stories that many of them had to endure because of colonisation and forced assimilation. MRG and 61 organizations call the UK Parliament to support ceasefire in Gaza We cannot afford to delay any longer. Private diplomacy and cautious statements are not enough – stronger action and accountability needs to be applied or the humanitarian catastrophe will likely surpass even the horrors we have seen over the last four months. Israel must end indefensible assault on Gaza We reject the unconditional support of many states for the Israeli government’s actions. We urge states to refrain from legitimizing these actions in the name of security and counterterrorism, as this feeds a harmful propaganda machine.
