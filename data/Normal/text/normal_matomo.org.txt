Matomo is used by more than 1,000,000 websites worldwide, including large corporations, SMEs, governments & non-profit organisations."​ European Commissionec.europa.eu/commission We absolutely love Matomo. The more we learn about this platform, the more we understand what an incredible value is being provided. We evaluated a handful of paid analytics platforms this year and found no compelling reason to switch. Michael Fatica - MetaLocatorChief Executive Officer "No matter whether we are working with granular or big-picture data, we always have confidence that we are making user-benefited decisions based on a complete data set. And having full control of our Matomo data is critical - we get to choose exactly how it's stored, managed and deleted." Philip Aggrey - MajesticCommercial Operations "Given our tradition in libraries to protect reader privacy, a compelling argument can be made that Google Analytics is inappropriate for libraries. After a review of alternatives to GA following Edward Snowden's revelations, we selected Matomo as a replacement for GA. Matomo is a free, open source, and most importantly, supports local data collection." Adam Chandler - Cornell University LibraryDirector "Matomo and Pimcore share a similar philosophy. Both are based on the doctrine that intellectual property such as software should be available to enterprises for free without having to pay any licensing cost. Both give companies full ownership and control of all data they collect and store. Thank's to the Matomo team for all your help and support! This tight integration makes all the new reporting features on our roadmap possible. We must admit that we are quite proud that Pimcore is currently the only content and user experience management system with a Matomo core integration."
