Recent SG⭐️⭐️⭐️ @GREENESJ333 Mar 5 Once a last resort, Title VI antisemitism complaints are now the ‘Wild West’ for Jews on campus 1) jta.org/2024/02/29/uni… It has become clear that the justice department is not arresting terror supporters threatening Jewish students & neighborhoods because the Biden Administration appointed Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke to lead the powerful Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. 2) Clarke has a history of anti-Semitic activism, is pro-Hamas, as well as a supporter of BLM. It is clear that despite all the Pro Hamas terror rallies on college campuses, the ripping down of hostage posters all around the country and 3) Read 6 tweets Stas Olenchenko 🇺🇦 @StasOlenchenko Mar 5 The anatomy of shilling for Russia or how to spot the wordings of a Russian asset/useful idiot. Let’s unpack Simon Jenkins’ @guardian outcry about NATO escalation to see how specific wordings expose a Russian propaganda asset. These wordings go beyond just Simon. A thread. 1/9 Simon says Germany sending Taurus is a “risky escalation”. It’s not. The UK and France already sent similar long-range systems, even the US sent a bit of their ATACMS. Taurus would help Ukraine a lot. But it’s not a game changer or a new development. 2/9 Simon fears the Taurus story looks like the West is leading a proxy war with Russia via Ukraine. He omits the fact that Russia openly admits it is already waging a war with the West via Ukraine — and it already uses hybrid warfare tactics and killings on the NATO soil. 3/9 Read 9 tweets 0xNobler @CryptoNobler Mar 5 $SIDE airdrop is confirmed and the snapshot can be any minute 🪂 Cost: $0 Potential Profit: $8,000 Time: 10 minutes Side has raised massive funding from the earliest investor in Ethereum 👀 Don't waste your chance and make sure you'll be eligible👇🧵 Before we begin, click on Follow and Bookmark this thread 🔖 Already did?

CHESEBRO also blamed Pence, just hours after the certification was complete, for giving Trump "false hope" and not squashing the theories about the VP's Jan. 6 power until the last minute. CHESEBRO sent a picture of himself to Jim Troupis at 12:24pm on Jan. 6, which would have been while Trump was speaking to is rally crowd.

First thing to say, this is far more structured thinking that the norm in mainstream UK politics and, mostly, interacts with the reality of what Europe is. Were Labour proposing this, it'd be quite solid 🧵 I have stated in the past, much like with Darwinian theory, that any evolution in the relationship has to be an improvement on the last *in and of itself* for Europe. 2 Important to remember that, as, although Andrew may see an end state, from Europe's perspective each change could be the final integration point. 3 Read 5 tweets 𝕆𝕙 𝕟𝕠, 𝕀𝕥'𝕤 𝕙𝕚𝕞.

Should be a 'home-based' position. @donturvLDR Mediation and Negotiation Skills: The Night Time Czar should have strong mediation and negotiation abilities to facilitate constructive discussions and find common ground between the city's council and the night time industry stakeholders. @donturvLDR Communication Skills: Effective communication is crucial in this role. The Czar should be able to articulate the interests and concerns of both parties, ensuring clear and transparent communication to foster understanding and collaboration.

The “get the videotape ready” ritual: 4 years before his historic 8 golds at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps stuck to a winning routine before every race. He has won 23 gold medals, set 10 world records, and 5 Olympic/American records. Here's his pre-match routine: Two hours early, he arrived. The routine: 800m mixer, 50m freestyle, 600m kickboard, 400m buoy pull, and more. Every move is precise, and every stroke is purposeful.

Even solar! ☀ Recently, I came across SundayGrids - they claim to make solar investments easy for those without a rooftop. They have approached it differently. Business model: 1. SundayGrids partners with a host to install a solar plant in their premises; 2. Investors "reserve" power generation from that project for 15 years; 3. Power generated is sold to the host at a fixed rate for 15 years (PPA+BOT); 4. These proceeds are repaid to investors in the form of "credits" linked to actual production. Credits can be used to offset electricity bills! 5. At year 16, host gets the plant for free.

In the match against Sheffield United alone, there were 4 examples I used with one of them resulting in the goal. Kai Havertz on His Style Of Play.

This is bad. But it's also an opportunity. 1/ Link: newrepublic.com/article/179548… The poll found that only 31 percent of non-MAGA voters in PA, MI, and AZ have a lot of awareness of Trump's most explicit authoritarian threats. The poll tested 10 of these. The survey is by veteran pollster @geoffgarin for the group Save My Country. 2/ newrepublic.com/article/179548… The good news is that when these voters were presented with Trump's authoritarian outbursts, negative impressions of him jumped substantially. They saw him as "dangerous" and "a dictator." 3/ As Garin told me: "This is an opportunity to move voters." newrepublic.com/article/179548… Read 5 tweets SG⭐️⭐️⭐️ @GREENESJ333 Mar 5 The schools and universities have been teaching crıtical race theory lies that flip Jewish history on its head and ignores the fact that 90% of all Jews can trace themselves to the Levant. 1) The Jews are the indigenous people of Eretz Yisrael and have been continuously for millenia. Judaism predates Islam by 1600 years. Now, they have taken it a step further and have weaponized the Holocaust. 2) Must see: Watch The Reason We Learn podcast with Deb Filman @deb_fillman: "Weaponizing the Definition of "Antisemitism" with Dr. Naya Lekht" @NayaLekht 3)youtube.com/live/EfSCk2WPc… Read 8 tweets See All Recent Did Thread Reader help you today?
