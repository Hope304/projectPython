Hollow Creek Rescue provides veterinary care, medicine, food, love, training, socialization, and seeks loving forever homes. HCF relies solely on donations and 100% of all donations go only to the care of rescued animals. Rescue is expensive with endless expenses to shelter, feed and care for animals. HCF pays for all food, vet care, medicine, housing, fencing, repairs, building supplies, gas, vehicles, tools, and equipment. Hollow Creek Farm relies on Farm Friends (donors) to spread the word about rescues so that more animals may be helped. We have no grants. We raise funds and receive donations from caring, concerned, kind people committed to saving the lives of furry guests. Won't you help us help them? P.O.
