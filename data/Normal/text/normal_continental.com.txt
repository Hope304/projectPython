The technology company has for the first time been included in the annual A list for its transparency and performance in relation to climate change. This makes Continental one of the few companies to achieve an “A” in the area of climate change mitigation.Each year, international non-profit organization CDP assesses the climate data of companies on behalf of investors and scores them on a scale from A to D-. Last year, more than 740 financial institutions with assets under management of around $136 trillion called on around 23,000 companies to disclose their environmental data. The results of the CDP ranking provide investors with an important basis for decision-making.Find out more about the recognition from CDPTOPIC SPECIAL: Farms Are Becoming Smart: with Bits and Bytes as Today’s Seeds According to estimates by the United Nations, there will be around 8.5 billion people living on the Earth by the year 2030 – around half a billion more than in 2023. But food is already scarce in many places today. And there are further challenges to consider in addition to this.In many industrialized countries such, stricter sustainability regulations have meant that the area of land used for agriculture has been shrinking for years, and fewer pesticides and fertilizers can be used. Lower margins for agricultural products, the shortage of skilled workers and the resulting surge in cost pressure present further challenges. In addition, climate change is causing more severe extreme weather events such as droughts and heavy rainfall, which make cultivation more difficult. Many soils are compacted, over-fertilized and leached. The answer to the agricultural challenges lies in one word: digitalization. Continental is one of the driving forces behind the progress taking place on farms.Click here for the story "Smart Farming" Career at Continental Shaping the future of mobility is not easy.
