An illustrative example: the photo generation in the Gemini app is not actually powered by the Gemini model. It’s an older, text-to-photo model that was tacked onto the Gemini user-facing experience to get the feature out the door faster.I’m told that there’s also a lack of alignment between Demis Hassabis’s research team building the underlying models and Prabhakar Raghavan’s search organization that’s putting them into user-facing products. Perhaps the coming “structural changes” Pichai hinted at in his memo to employees last week will address that.Google’s morale crisis is about to get worseAlex HeathMar 4TechTechOregon is about to sign — or veto — the strongest right-to-repair law yetSean Hollister1:47 AM UTC|CommentsEExternal LinkCommentsElizabeth Lopatto12:54 AM UTCLinkWhat’s attending a Formula 1 race like?This is a spectacular read even if you don’t care about car racing.

Here’s one example: Where should your child file taxes if she goes to college out of state? When I asked, TurboTax’s “Intuit Assist” bot offered irrelevant advice about tax credits and extensions. H&R Block’s “AI Tax Assist” bot gave me the wrong impression she has to file in both places. (The correct answer: She only files in the other state if she has earned income there.) Question after question, I got many of the same random, misleading or inaccurate AI answers. H&R Block announced AI Tax Assist in December, while Turbo Tax released a similar service in November. Both companies have said AI chatbots learned from the same datasets human experts use to answer tax questions, but their disclaimers mention that users should always double-check AI-provided advice.

The agency tried to make companies disclose their energy use through an emergency data request.

On Friday, the DOE agreed to destroy information it’s already collected.
