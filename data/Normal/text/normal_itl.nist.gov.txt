ITL focuses on IT measurements, testing, and standards, and is a globally recognized and trusted source of high-quality, independent, and unbiased research and data. ITL’s mission, to cultivate trust in information technology (IT) and metrology, is accomplished using its world-class measurement and testing facilities and encompassing a wide range of areas of computer science, mathematics, statistics, and systems engineering. This non-regulatory role, along with ITL’s deep technical expertise in all fields of information technology, helps increase trust in IT worldwide. ITL Newsletters Published bimonthly, the ITL Newsletter features news articles on ITL's programs, projects, activities, and accomplishments. It announces selected new ITL publications and describes upcoming technical conferences and workshops. Sign up for ITL Newsletters! ITL BULLETINS The ITL Bulletin focuses on ITL’s research and collaborative activities in cybersecurity. It often announces new ITL publications in information security and gives an overview of the research contained within. Sign up for ITL Bulletins!
