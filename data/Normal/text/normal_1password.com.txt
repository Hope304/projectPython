Because weak and reused passwords are a leading cause of security incidents, using a password manager is an easy way to protect yourself, your family, or your business. 1Password is also much more than a password manager. It can safely store your sensitive documents, banking information, medical records, SSH keys (for developers), and many other secrets. It’s easy to share those items and collaborate securely, too. Plus, membership comes with a ton of perks, like Masked Email integration from Fastmail, signing in with other providers like Apple and Google, and actionable security recommendations from Watchtower.Is 1Password free to use?1Password is free to try for 14 days, after which you'll be asked to select the plan that best fits your needs.

Your data, including vault name and website URLs, is fully encrypted on our servers. Even if an attacker were to breach our servers, they wouldn’t be able to read your data without your account password and Secret Key – neither of which are known to or stored by us. Learn more about the 1Password approach to cloud-based storage and syncing on the 1Password blog.Can 1Password be trusted?Yes, but you don’t have to take our word for it.
