Home | phpDocumentor phpDocumentor About Documentation Becausecode and documentationare meant to be together. phpDocumentor is the de-facto documentation application for PHP projects. Your project can benefit too from more than 20 years of experience and setting the standard for documenting PHP Applications. Documentation FeaturesWhat can phpDocumentor 3 do to help you with your documentation Super easy to install and use Thanks to the power of Docker or PHAR Creates Beautiful Documentation Learns everything about your code and uses that to make sure you have the best documentation.

More control using DocBlocks Uses the information from your DocBlocks to provide even more insight. Full-Text Search Need to find that one method? Full-text search is supported, even offline. CI Support out of the box Integrate it into your CI pipeline with our Github Action or Docker image UsageEasy to install, and to use! Getting started using the PHAR Start by downloading our latest PHAR file and giving it a nice and cozy place on your hard drive. $ wget https://phpdoc.org/phpDocumentor.phar After you downloaded the PHAR file, don't forget to power it up by making it executable. $ chmod +x phpDocumentor.phar Also, you may want to consider renaming it to phpdoc; we'll understand. Then, all you need to do is run it! Getting started using Docker Use our very own Docker image; no installation needed! Treat our docker image like you treat all your other utility images. Just don't forgot to volume mount your current directory to /data inside the container. Remember: No data, No docs. $ docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/data phpdoc/phpdoc:3 Tada! But wait? What about Composer? Ah, you discovered our secret. There is a phpDocumentor composer package that you could use to install phpDocumentor. However: phpDocumentor is a complex application, and its libraries are used in countless other libraries and applications (2 of our libraries have more than 150 million downloads each); and this means that the chances for a conflict between one of our dependencies and yours is high. And when I say high, it is really high. So, because of the above: we do not endorse nor actively support installing phpDocumentor using Composer.
