ABOUT RETAILER OPPORTUNITIES Expanding Incremental Reach Not everyone shops the same way. Connexity accesses diverse channels to find you more customers where they actively shop. ABOUT CONNEXITY CHANNELS Recommending Connexity “Connexity has delivered incremental sales revenue and new customers outside of traditional paid search. Their access to premium supply channels and proprietary Smart Pricing technology has ensured our ad spend is consistently aligned with our profitability goals. Our sales revenue has grown 20-25% annually and their free managed service has been clutch. It’s removed the burden of daily campaign oversight and allowed us to take a more strategic and collaborative approach.” Madeleine Backfield Media Activation Manager, Lenovo US “We look at the ROI on incremental spend and the fact that Connexity’s is strong puts you in a very strong position when planning spend with partners. For the UK, Connexity is at the top end of efficiency ratings within the space, which is very positive.” Richard Lane Partnerships Lead, eBay “Our Connexity partnership helps Tinuiti over-deliver for retail clients. The additional reach of Connexity’s exclusive channels outperforms standard Google and Bing ads on the KPIs we care about. We look forward to continuing to deliver this type of performance for our clients and will be recommending more retailers advertise through Connexity.” Courtney O’Donnell Director of Shopping & Feed, Tinuiti “Connexity grew our sales revenue 224% YoY aligned with our cost-of-sale objectives. The best part is, they accomplished this without increasing our workload. We placed our trust in their complimentary managed service offering and the results speak for themselves. We are thrilled with our partnership and look forward to continuing similar growth trends in the years to come.“ Regan Bigelow Search Engine Mktg Mgr., Adam & Eve “Whatever the economy chooses to do, with Connexity the results are consistent and reliable. Unlike other digital channels, it is not overtly volatile and because of that we get a consistently good ROAS and new-to-file ratio.” Kevin Babbage Head of Digital, Coopers of Stortford “Connexity is an amazing source of new customers and incremental sales. Been working with them for 10+ years and Connexity has always been a part of our ecommerce channel mix. They have always been proactive in working with us to achieve and exceed revenue and ROAS goals. The CSE PLA program provides additional exposure on Google and Bing and has proven to be complementary (not competitive) with our direct PLA campaigns.” Mac Simagrai Director of Digital Acquisition, Ariat International CONNEXITY 2120 Colorado Ave. Ste. 400 Santa Monica, CA 90404 (310) 571-1235 Login Contact Us Careers Privacy Policy / Cookie policy / California Privacy Notice / Ad Opt-Out / DO NOT SELL OR SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION / ACCESSIBILITY / Connexity is a Taboola company /
