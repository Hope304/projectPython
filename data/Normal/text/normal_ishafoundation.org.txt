He explains how the process creates such unimaginable suffering, but just for one moment right before death, after which nothing of the past remains in you. Sadhguru says, "Kalabhairava is a deadly form of Shiva. It was guaranteed if you come to Kashi, you will attain to mukti, it doesn't matter what kind of a lousy creature you have been all your life."Feb 29, 2024Loading...Loading...Receive Sadhguru’s quote every day in your inbox.CountryIndiaUnited StatesAfghanistanAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBritish Virgin IslandsBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCabo VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandClipperton IslandCocos [Keeling] IslandsColombiaComorosCongo - BrazzavilleCongo - KinshasaCook IslandsCosta RicaCroatiaCubaCyprusCzech RepublicCôte d’IvoireDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGuernseyGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHondurasHong Kong SAR ChinaHungaryIcelandIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKosovoKuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacau SAR ChinaMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmar [Burma]NamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNetherlands AntillesNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorth KoreaNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian TerritoriesPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairn IslandsPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRomaniaRussiaRwandaRéunionSaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth KoreaSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaSão Tomé and PríncipeTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluU.S. Outlying IslandsU.S. Virgin IslandsUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVatican CityVenezuelaVietnamWallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabweLanguageSign UpEducation Conscious PlanetOne Life, Touching AnotherLearn MoreEnvironmentRural UpliftmentTogether with its active and dedicated volunteer base, Isha Foundation's activities serve as a thriving model for human empowerment and community revitalization throughout the world.Volunteeringis a way of giving backIn every aspect of life, Sadhguru explains, we can be a volunteer just by living willingly.

Today, with fake news, paid media and social media at hand, we see these vested groups weaving a systematized web of lies, finding insidious ways to malign the Foundation. In spite of the fact that there is not ONE court case filed by any Government Body, these groups have created chimeras of nuisance suits and attempted repeatedly to mire the Foundation in controversy and bad press. As our commitment to over 11 million volunteers and over a billion well-wishers worldwide, in response to repeated appeals from them to publish the truth, we now stand up and provide answers to the most commonly asked questions.Jun 4, 2019Loading...Loading...BlogMusicIsha DownloadsMedia & Press ReleaseYogaSadhguru AcademyIsha HomeschoolIsha SamskritiIsha LifeIsha Health SolutionsProject SamskritiSubscribeJoin 1.2 Million people from around the world, get wisdom articles delivered in the mailbox for free.Subscribe NowContact UsSingaporeIsha Foundation Ltd.5008 Ang Mo Kio Ave 5,Techplace II#05-14/15/16, Singapore569874+65-61004064singapore@ishayoga.orgDownload Sadhguru AppFind us on Social Media© 1999 - 2023 Isha Foundation.
