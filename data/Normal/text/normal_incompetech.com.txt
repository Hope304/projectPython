Accelerating Fun Posted on December 24, 2023 by Kevin MacLeod Posted in Music Sergio’s Magic Dustbin This piece starts very slow and builds… like Bolero. Unlike Bolero, this piece builds beyond the safety limit and gets crazy. I recommend you check out the piece from 1 minute 48 seconds in. There are several break points you can start from to get to the crazy payoff faster, or use the whole thing! You can purchase from iTunes here! Is this one of those ADHD tracks? Posted on December 23, 2023 by Kevin MacLeod Posted in Music Equatorial Complex Enjoy a serene sanctuary where time stands still. Envelop yourself in a warm, nostalgic embrace, evoking the feeling of a sun-drenched afternoon in a hidden garden. The air is filled with the echoes of a distant, yet familiar, world, inviting you to lose yourself in the comforting simplicity of the moment… You can purchase from iTunes here! Deck in, chummer! Posted on December 22, 2023 by Kevin MacLeod Posted in Music Brain Dance Immerse yourself in the pulsating beats of “Brain Dance,” a sonic experience that plunges you deep into the heart of the Sixth World. Conjured amidst the neon glow and astral currents of a dystopian Seattle, this track is the essence of a Decker’s paradise. Synthwave textures weave an intricate matrix around you, leaving you entangled in its cybernetic allure. Deck in, chummer, and let the futuristic soundscape rewrite your reality. Wait… what universe is this set in? You can purchase from iTunes here! Ohhhh… Now, I get it.
