More from UAB Magazine Event Highlights All Events Add Event College is for growing, so do not be afraid to make mistakes and grow. Dr. Shaia helped me believe in myself and grow into someone who can go into a career and be successful. — Sam Pugh, Communications major with a concentration in Public Relations, Class of 2023 The way that the instructors at UAB have set up their coursework, I feel equally engaged with my peers, and I very much feel like I’m in a classroom. It’s just as rewarding as being on campus. — Tyler Fowler, Psychology major, Class of 2023 I gave up everything I had to come to UAB. However, I knew this was something that I wanted to do no matter the personal fears and doubts I had.... Now I’m leaving this program with eight research publications and three prepared to submit, which serves as a reminder of the quality of UAB’s education. — George Green, Ph.D. Biology graduate, Fall 2023 Just the faculty, the lengths they will go through to [help you] figure it out. It’s just crazy how willing they are to help and how much they care about us — as creatives, as actual human beings — separate from what we are doing as a career. — Troy Serena, musical theatre major, Class of 2023 Being on campus, and the fact that it is a young university and I have the chance to play a role in shaping the impact it has, was really meaningful to me, and that is why I chose UAB. — Ritika Samant, neuroscience major, Class of 2023 Coming from a small high school, I knew I wanted to go to a college that did not have any closed gates or doors — where I could meet people from all over — and that’s what I have found at UAB. — Chandler Mull, Class of 2022, kinesiology major UAB has not only shown me to believe in myself, but there is opportunity for everyone, and it doesn’t matter if you have a disability. UAB is one of the best colleges that focuses on diversity. — Cheqana Jervey, history major, Class of 2020 I always knew my career path wouldn’t be the same as other people. With faculty help, I was networking at conferences and even taking a business class when it interested me. — Physics alumna Christina Richey, Ph.D. Alumni Parents & Family Future Students Current Students International Students Faculty Employees Media Careers at UAB Canvas The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Main Switchboard: (205) 934-4011 Hearing Impaired/TDD: (205) 934-4642 Contact Us Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | © 2024 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
