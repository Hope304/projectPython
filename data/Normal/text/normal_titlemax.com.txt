TitleMax offers car title loans up to $10,000*, and we focus on getting you the most cash possible while keeping your payments manageable.

If you have a clear car title and a government-issued ID, you can get a title pawn with TitleMax even if you have bad credit. Already have a title pawn with someone else? Switch to TitleMax! In most cases, we can lower the rate on your existing pawn and pay off your current loan.
