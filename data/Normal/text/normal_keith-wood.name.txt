Keith Wood Keith Wood Intro jQuery Plugins jQuery Thoughts Introduction I live in Sydney, Australia, where I work for Nine Publishing as a JavaScript Developer. Over the years I have contributed several jQuery plugins to the jQuery community. See the jQuery Plugins tab for more details. And I have written a book on developing jQuery plugins: Extending jQuery Extending jQuery is Manning's Deal of the Day on October 18. Use code dotd101815au when purchasing for half off the normal price. Earlier I used Delphi and JBuilder from their first releases and contributed many OpenTools to the JBuilder community. I was also a frequent contributor of technical articles to Delphi Informant, Delphi Developer's Journal, Hardcore Delphi, and The Delphi Magazine magazines. I wrote three books on these topics: Delphi Developer's Guide to XML, 2nd Edition Inside the JBuilder OpenTools API I also did the initial development for log4d, a port of log4j to Delphi, and SAX for Pascal. I have dabbled with ambigrams too and dance a bit as well as write dances in Contra, English Country, Scottish, and Australian styles. I run a monthly series of dance workshops in Sydney. I have produced two collections of Contra dances written by Australians and three collections of my own dances.
