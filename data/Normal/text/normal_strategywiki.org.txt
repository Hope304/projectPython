In Pocket Fighter, twelve characters from various Capcom fighting franchises, including Street Fighter Alpha, Street Fighter III, Darkstalkers, and the lesser known Red Earth game, are depicted in super-deformed, or "chibi", artwork style. Using a simplified fighting system, the game is a lighthearted poke at some of Capcom's own successful fighting games. all featured guides · nominate · what is this?
