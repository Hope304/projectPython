Honshu Island, Japan The ideal conical shape of Mount Fuji has inspired Japanese poets and artists from time immemorial. And the danger lurking inside added spice and made people treat the mountain with respect, because Fuji is an active volcano that last erupted in 1707. The mountain has been worshiped since ancient times: Shintoists considered Fuji to be the abode of the gods, Taoists looked for an elixir of immortality on it, and Buddhists and Shugendo followers meditated on the top. Now they climb Fuji in July and August, when the snow cap disappears, the way back and forth along a good trail takes 8-12 hours. Upstairs, you can not only feel like a true Japanese, but also look into the Hongu Sengen Shinto shrine, to which Fuji officially belongs since 1609. Detailed guide Fuji is an active volcano located on Honshu Island in Fuji-Hakone Izu National Park. Today the volcano is almost inactive. The last eruption was recorded in 1707-1708. It is worth noting that this was one of the most powerful eruptions in the entire existence of Mount Fuji. Then in Edo (the old name of Tokyo), a layer of ash formed 15 cm. Many of you have probably seen the image of Mount Fuji in Japanese art. In almost all engravings, the volcano is depicted with sharp inaccessible peaks and in the snow. However, in fact, it is not so difficult to conquer the mountain, and there is not always snow there. Most of the travelers flock to this attraction in July and August – it is during these months that Mount Fuji is free of snow. At this peak of the tourist season, all the amenities for guests of the country and local pilgrims are provided here: shops, small cafes, rescue centers and places for recreation are open. It is interesting that the Japanese have provided absolutely everything – there are even toilets here. Moreover, this is the only place in all of Japan where you have to pay to enter public areas. By the way, many toilets are solar powered and even have a heated seat. Keep in mind that the ascent will take 3 to 8 hours and the descent will take 2 to 5 hours, depending on your fitness level. The entire route is divided into stations. As a rule, tourists get to the fifth station by taxi or bus, and then they stomp on foot. At the very top of Fuji is a Shinto shrine, a post office and a weather station. There are a lot of hot springs on the volcano and near its foot. Remember that littering is strictly prohibited on Mount Fuji. According to local regulations, if you purchase water from the store during the climb, you can only throw away one empty bottle. All travelers are given special garbage bags. Every year about 200 thousand people climb Mount Fuji. There are only four official routes that take you to the top of the volcano. The rest of the trails are quite dangerous and difficult, which is why you should not trust unscrupulous guides. The unsecured routes are used exclusively for bulldozers that deliver food and various goods for shops.

There are 2 points in this question: psychological and practical. There are obviously more sites covering the practical moment, there is nothing complicated here, you just need to take and do everything step by step, as experts advise.
