Scripting News SCRIPTING NEWS It's even worse than it appears.. © copyright 1994-2024 Dave Winer. Last update: Monday March 4, 2024; 8:59 PM EST. You know those obnoxious sites that pop up dialogs when they think you're about to leave, asking you to subscribe to their email newsletter? Well that won't do for Scripting News readers who are a discerning lot, very loyal, but that wouldn't last long if I did rude stuff like that. So here I am at the bottom of the page quietly encouraging you to sign up for the nightly email. It's got everything from the previous day on Scripting, plus the contents of the linkblog and who knows what else we'll get in there. People really love it. I wish I had done it sooner. And every email has an unsub link so if you want to get out, you can, easily -- no questions asked, and no follow-ups. Go ahead and do it, you won't be sorry! :-) davew@mastodon.social Monday, March 4, 2024 There's been a slowdown in feedland.org, I believe it's related to a limit reached on the database server. But for now you may see it take a long time to load pages. I have a ticket open with Digital Ocean. Update: Problem fixed. # Old enough to know better# There are advantages to being older.# Sunday, March 3, 2024 This is how parents sent email to their kids at summer camp in 1968.# If the Democrats had a sense of the moment they'd run the campaign on a plan to regain control of the House and keep the Senate and White House so we can pass a law that legalizes abortion in the whole country. Give people a positive reason to elect a governing majority. Think powerfully. # Sarah Sherman is incredible, like a Gilda Radner or John Belushi, she becomes the character she's playing, but she's still herself. # Biden is a fine president# I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and proto-blogger Jeff Jarvis, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just made it a blog post. # The thing about Gaza is that there's the rest of the world, and they're watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been such an asshole to the US. He's a freaking MAGA. # So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure. The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there's another path, compassion and help. # Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But they're doing it the only way we can, given who we are. # Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we never have. Journos seem to think Americans can't understand the basics of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn't really any more complicated. # Saturday, March 2, 2024 There's a rule in covering elections that they don't make projections or even analyze results on TV until all the polls are closed. We need an analogous rule that says there should be no reporting on polls until after the election, to allow the people to form their own opinions, for the same reason. Also, people are less likely to vote if they feel the outcome is a foregone conclusion. People even form their decision re who to vote for based on the polls. That's not a very healthy way for a country to govern itself. # The big deal with ChatGPT is that it's a huge improvement over search. Instead of hunting for clues to the info you need, you can ask the question you have and get an answer. It has encyclopedic knowledge of all the development environments I use. And it knows how to put the pieces together. I don't care how it does it, it's a much higher level tool than search. Like the difference between a calculator and a computer. # When I was a grad student in Comp Sci, I was a teaching assistant for a class in assembly language programming for a couple of years. One of my responsibilities was to grade the work of the students. Later, I was the CEO and lead developer at a software company I founded, and there I had to review other people's source code. I was pretty fussy about writing understandable code, because it was my job in both places to understand their code, and I also knew, even when I was just a TA, how important it is that your code be human-readable, not just machine-readable. I just want to say if ChatGPT were a student of mine, its code would get an A+, with thanks from the teacher for making my life easier. # Actually it would get an A+ if it were a student, but not a very high grade for a member of my development team, because it can't seem to learn my coding style. I've pasted an awful lot of my code into its "tiny little text box". # Ben Werdmuller explains why he won't have a blogroll. This is the kind of thread we used to form in the old school blogosphere. I don't have an opinion about whether he will or won't have one, but for me, the process of putting this together in 2024 has been a really good thing. I'm better in touch with what other people are doing. My blogroll does more than it did 20 years ago. Actually it's a lot like his Sources page, but more compact. I'm glad we're having this discussion. It's exactly what I hoped would happen. And of course my feed list is behind my blogroll. # Friday, March 1, 2024 The archive for February 2024, in OPML. # Blogs for social web apps# In a new product I'm working on, I'm including links to the blogs of the social media apps I use. I notice that most of them have one. This is why:# You can put a title on a post on a blog.# You can include links (invariably announcements have links).# You can edit posts.# Simple text styling.# Blogs have feeds.# So I'm looking for the official blogs of the social apps I use -- Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter, Threads. # If so, what's the feed URL? # Here's a place to comment.# PS: It seems dumb to have two places for writing. Also I bet Bluesky wrote their own blogging software, which is why there's no feed for their blog, which is awkward because Bluesky itself has feeds. As a programmer, I don't think I could maintain both codebases, and i'm pretty sure the blog is the one that'll get abandoned. Update: they do have a feed for their blog. At some point there won't be a distinction between blogging and social media-ing. Remember the tiny little text boxes have to go. 😄# PPS: Twitter's blog has a really shitty title, it shows up in the list as English (UK). That should be fixed to something like Twitter Blog. I know how this happens, obviously they're maintaining more than one language, so the title is given from their point of view. As a reader, it has to make sense in a list of feeds from different publishers. Here's a screen shot to illustrate. # I see the bright lights of Memphis# My friend Brad Pettit is playing with ChatGPT's image drawing capability, and had a brilliant idea, feed it the lyrics to a song and see what it comes back with. He tried Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys by Traffic, a great song, and the image was really cool. # This game me the idea to try it with a few of my favorite songs. # Dixie Chicken# A Apolitical Blues# Call Any Vegetable# Thursday, February 29, 2024 If the state of journalism is so bad from a business side, and if it's not serving the people very well, I wonder if we could work out some kind of deal here?# If we want even a modest reboot of blogging, as a community thing, we're going to have to start with something like blogrolls. I wrote a bit yesterday about how blogrolls came about, then weblogs.com and how that led to RSS and feed readers. This time, we don't have to wait for feeds to show up, they're already here. It should happen more quickly. # Today's song: Will The Circle Be Unbroken.# Wednesday, February 28, 2024 There are a lot of blogging communities out there in 2024, but we don't think of them that way. But they totally behave like a blogging community. I remember when I was starting weblogs.com, I wanted to get an idea of when sites were updating, so I didn't have to go hunting through a blogroll, clicking on links to find out if there was anything new. So I wrote a script that worked off a list of blogs, read each one in turn, and compared it with the last version we read, and if there was a change, it would move it to the top of the list. I didn't just make it for myself, I shared it with everyone. There was a mail list where people were freaking out about this. The server that would read their blog every so often was called subhonker. This was something new and they were scared. I couldn't show them the benefit until the script had been running for a while. Everyone got upset. I remember being confused and scared, but I guess from their point of view it looked scary. I don't know. In the end weblogs.com became really popular, it became the central place to find out what's new with blogs, and then evolved to use RSS so we could find changes in even more detail. I guess the thing is people should see the benefit before they see the price? And as an innovator, we have to be aware of this, people may not see the benefit until they can use it. # I'm waiting for someone to give me the tools to index my own content so ChatGPT knows about it. I want it to learn my codebase so I can ask it questions about places I've used a feature before. I want to write code in a very high level language I invent as I go and have it compile it to JavaScript. Come on, what's holding things up. This will be the ultimate productivity software. The first one who gets there owns the world or at least deserves a nice prize and our thanks. # I use Safari on my iPad. The software just updated, and they widened the width of icons in the browser chrome. This knocked three of my links over into the menu, out of easy reach. Why did they feel they could change something so basic? After using the iPad for 14 freaking years, why shake up this tiny little corner of the system? What's the possible benefit. Or maybe this is just a bug and they'll fix it? This is the kind of thing that makes me put off updating. Yeah I know it sounds small, but I really use my freaking iPad. It isn't just for watching movies. I can't tell you how many iPads I've bought. It's ridiculous. Come on Apple, I'm a customer not a slave. # Re the Michigan primary returns -- I think it's great that 15% of Democratic voters voted uncommitted -- because that's democracy, and it does not hurt Biden at all to have the voters express themselves, esp when I'm pretty sure he agrees. Biden is a Democrat, and Netanyahu is a MAGA. Remember that. They are not friends, and Biden has dropped very explicit hints that he's thinking that way. So give him an excuse to kick Netanyahu in the ass, and he'll be happy to do it. But he can't openly threaten Israel now, not with Trump over there saying he'd cut NATO, and thanks to him we're ditching Ukraine, even though Trump isn't in office. All of our alliances are fragile now, and getting worse every time Trump says or does something awful. Biden has to take it steady. I listened to the interviews with advocates for uncommitted, and no one even remotely suggested they'll vote for Trump or a Republican. This is democracy. It's good. That's as American as it gets. # Another way to think about it. What if, say in California or New York, 15% of the Democrats voted uncommitted to make sure Biden knows he's expected to stand up strong for reproductive rights. That helps clear the way with any Democrats who feel they should go slowly. Voters expressing their political strength. Again, that's pure democracy. It's the best.# Think of it this way -- voting is governing. We have a lot of power but only if we use it.# Tuesday, February 27, 2024 There's a new faster version of news.scripting.com coming. I was originally thinking I'd do the switch today, but decided to hold it for a bit. I want to do more testing and development.# Ocean warming is a bad thing. Ocean currents determine the weather all around the world, accounting for a relatively mild environment in Europe, for example, even though a city like London is on the same parallel as Winnipeg. Once the current is disrupted, people will find their buildings are not prepared for the change, or the cost of heating homes, or growing food. # In the 80s there was a tech press that reviewed software, and explained OSes and hardware, so you really had a good idea what was going on. They just don't do that anymore. Haven't for many years. But along comes ChatGPT and I can get a comparitive review of hosting services that compete with Digital Ocean, just by asking for it. I wanted to get an idea of how easy it would be to create an open source app so it could be easily deployed, on any of them and what the pros and cons were. I asked for a comparison between Digital Ocean (where I host my servers now) and Amazon, Microsoft, Google and I threw in Glitch, just to anchor the whole thing simplicity-wise. Even InfoWorld wouldn't have done such an in-depth review. This is a productivity revolution, at least.# My Threads timeline is full of Kara Swisher the last few days. She has a book coming out. I think she's popular with other journalists. Her theme appears to be that it's the personalities that matter, not what the companies do. I don't think she has a whole lot of insight into the products and technology. For some reason tech, which mystifies a lot of history and english majors, is considered irrelevant or optional, or maybe kind of cute, by the typical reporter. So she expresses tech in terms the journalists understand, therefore they like her. # Monday, February 26, 2024 Not much blogging here today. A lot of writing in other contexts. # Sunday, February 25, 2024 Went out to eat, nice pizza place in Phoenicia. There was a guy wearing a brand new Trump hat. I've never seen that in a public place. Otherwise he looked perfectly normal. I wondered what kind of weirdo has that kind of hate in his heart. Is he listening to what Trump is saying these days? I didn't want to ask him. These are our Nazis. They've hated us their whole lives. Until now, I never knew they existed. And now they get to parade around in public with these obscene hats on. When will the swastikas start appearing on the hats. I wonder if this is the first of many. Like the Germans partying at Rick's place in Casablanca. One more thing. Have you heard about the Civil War movie coming out later this year. Watch the trailer. Maybe wait till morning, because you might have trouble sleeping. # BTW, apparently my post yesterday where I said I was "doing some of my best writing in ChatGPT" was confusing. I meant literally what I said. My writing. Not that I was using ChatGPT to do my writing for me. I can understand that some people do that, writing isn't one of their things. However writing is one of my things. I've been writing every day for almost thirty years. My writing style has changed a lot over the years. I don't necessarily think it's gotten better, it's just different. I would never post writing publicly written by a anyone other than me without saying it was. Writing for me is very personal. On the other hand, I don't draw very well, never have. I used to be good at box diagrams with arrows, but I'm really out of practice. So if you see something colorful here, that was drawn by a bot, unless it says otherwise. I think we all have to be very clear about that. Now, I do write a lot in ChatGPT because I'm trying to get it to help me solve problems, almost always technical. Basically you have to sketch out the problem in English very specifically so it gives you back what you want. I never thought I'd be programming in English, but here I am doing it. I really want a copy of everything I write, because someday I might want to feed it into a bot other than ChatGPT. There's the lock-in. They own part of me, and I don't even get a copy. Yes yes I know I can download individual conversations, but not if they include an image btw, did you think of that? And who has time to remember to download them. This is fucked up. One of my action items is to hook Drummer up to their API so I'm not relying on their editor. Every time you find yourself typing into a tiny little text box the alarms should go off. # There's a Beatles song, by John Lennon, that was written by cribbing promotional items from a 19th-century circus poster. It's kind of like asking ChatGPT to give you some random phrases and presenting that as your creativity. I think I'm going to try that now. I asked ChatGPT to write a poem using ideas from a random song written by John Lennon. It chose Imagine. I asked that it write a poem using the ideas in Day Tripper. And finally I asked it to write a song based on the story of The Matrix. # When I see the word "blogrolls" on my screen, in big letters, my brain always sees "bagels" first. I guess we know what's on my mind. 💥# Saturday, February 24, 2024 It just occurred to me that I'm doing some of my best writing in ChatGPT, and I don't automatically get a copy of all that text somewhere I can access it if they go away. Also that writing is not going into any search engine. Normally I watch out for this, but they got me, and you, to write for them for free, and I pay them $20 a month for the privilege. However in balance it is worth it, at least in the short term.# Unfortunately ChatGPT has been down just when I needed it for some SQL coding help, so I turned to Google's service, and then thought to paste the post above into it's tiny little text box, and see what it had to say. It suggests, among other things, that I reconsider whether ChatGPT is a good deal. Heh. 😄# Friday, February 23, 2024 The other day I asked if an op-ed columnist at the NYT or WP would ever criticize their employer for showing poor judgment on what to report on, esp re the election. I was thinking of the story about the special prosecutor who did something highly unethical in writing a public, official, condemnation of someone he investigated yet decided not to prosecute. We have judges and juries for that. Only in a police state can a prosecutor pass judgment on an accused person. The news orgs took the bait, I didn't read one report on who Robert K. Hur is, and the ethics of what he did. Is it appropriate to quote a person who was behaving so openly unethically, esp if you don't disclaim that up front. It's not that democracy is on the ballot this year, we're already over the line. Our journalism is acting as if it were already controlled by the authoritarians. Our lack of trust in journalism is our biggest problem. How can we force journalism to start to be a little accountable. Right now they're the only part of our ruling class that can't have their choices reviewed. # Old enough to know besteer# I came up with a motto for Joe Biden's presidential campaign -- Old Enough to Know Better.# I asked ChatGPT to draw a campaign rally with a banner that said that, but it wouldn't do it for Joe Biden, so I changed the name to Bull Mancuso, and had him run for governor of Calif instead of president of the US. # It still couldn't spell the banner correctly but it is pretty inspiring.# The banner should read "Old Enough to Know Better."# Thursday, February 22, 2024 I have the motto for the Biden campaign: Old enough to know better. Uncle Joe, sit down with a reporter you can relate to, and explain what aging is about. How there's good and bad that come with getting on, and Repubs (of course) have been focusing on the bad but the journalists aren't getting the other side. One thing is for sure, it's hard to put one over on someone who's been in politics at the highest level for as long as President Joe has been. That's what the "know better" part is about. Whatever you can say about him, he knows a lot about being president. I've been using this motto as my own tagline for a while. But in the interest of protecting our democracy, I think the president should use it for his re-election campaign. No charge. 😄# Another Beatles post # Even though they are, for me, the biggest band ever, I've never been able to see the connection to the John Lennon of the early Beatles, and the long-haired bespectacled wild John Lennon that came later. I don't see them as the same person. Not the other Beatles, they all make sense to me. Sometimes they have longer hair or a beard or whatever, but it's still the same face as before. Also I have trouble figuring out which Beatle is singing sometimes. On some songs it's perfectly obvious, others I have no clue. For example Norwegian Wood, Come Together, Strawberry Fields and Lucy in the Sky, that's John of course. Right? Hey Jude, that's clearly Paul, as is Let it Be, Yesterday. But for years I didn't know who sang Lady Madonna. Martha My Dear? Paul could sing so many different kinds of music. John, not so much. I guess. I'm still pretty unsure. # ChatGPT designed a civilization# What I asked for: Imagine a version of The Sims or SimCity that had ChatGPT integrated,. You could create whole civilizations and then explore them, and if there was something you didn't like, you could have your way. No rule of law for you! You are the law. I wonder if you could draw me a Sims-like community as ChatGPT would design it.# "Here's a visual representation of a vibrant, utopian community as imagined with the integration of ChatGPT's design principles. This community blends futuristic architecture harmoniously with nature, featuring energy-efficient homes, community centers, and public spaces all connected by pedestrian pathways and lush gardens. Solar panels and wind turbines integrate seamlessly into the buildings, and the central plaza acts as a hub for gatherings, surrounded by parks, sports fields, and a lake for water activities. This illustration embodies an ideal balance between technology and nature, promoting health, well-being, and environmental stewardship."# I don't care if you're at a BigCo# I don't care if you work at a big company or are an individual developer. # I care if you can make a contribution toward interop on the open web. # I've found over the years that sometimes devs at bigco's can help enormously (eg microsoft, netscape, automattic) but more often they are harmful (apple, ibm, sun, google stand out as the worst). Sometimes companies play both roles (apple).# But i also know that bigco's because they are big, have lots of different ideas how the world should work. And that can help.# Twitter's big competitive advantage# I wrote this on Twitter this morning. Re-posted here with minimal editing. The fact that I could write it on Twitter was the point.# Twitter has one advantage over all the other social webs. no character limit. # I started typing a post on Threads which has a large character limit compared to the others, but ran out of space and decided to write it over here in twitter instead. # yes they charge me $8 a month for it, but it's worth it. # we have to get used to the idea of paying for value, it's how we avoid the messes of the last 20 years. esp if we can make sure we retain copies of everything we write (guaranteed by using our own writing tools, btw) which is another requirement for the new blogosphere. # btw, i'm having a blast these days. it's like tinkerbell in peter pan. all the open web needed was people to believe it exists for it to come (back) into existence.# still diggin. # ps: i also like they have simple styling, but where are the freaking links, twitter. do I have to pay another $8 to get those??# pps: the worst character limit is bluesky, i can't write anything there. too bad, it's a really nice system otherwise.# ppps: it would be nice to give something like this a title so you don't have to read pgf after pgf to try to figure out where i'm going and if you're interested. so i gave it a title, using markdown syntax. maybe they could just support markdown. hmmm.# pppps: i asked chatgpt to draw an illustration. that light in the middle of the room is the open social web. it's a vision of self-reliance, empowerment and cooperation. I asked for the light to be tinkerbell, but i guess they were concerned the image might belong to someone. creeping shitification. # This is not a picture of Tinkerbell.# Wednesday, February 21, 2024 Today's song: "Old enough to know better." # Threads is like a new airport, like Denver's airport was a few years ago, and Twitter feels like the old LaGuardia. Not sure what Mastodon feels like. I'll have to think about that. Maybe the airport in New Orleans which is called Armstrong Field now, IIRC. It used to be called MSY and it still is actually, even though the name changed. Power of standards. # Consider this quote from a WP article about a court ruling on abortion in Alabama. “Women who actually know what happened, feel under attack and almost powerless.” When historians look back on this election, they will be amazed that all the attention wasn't focused on reproductive rights, esp when 1. It mattered so much to virtually every American, in very real non-abstract ways, and 2. There was such a dramatic difference between the two parties and candidates on this issue. I think I understand why journalism can't get there. Because they would have to turn the agenda over to the people, and give up a power they have and enjoy, even if that power has repeatedly sent us wildly in the wrong direction, focusing on things that don't matter as much as the gut-wrenching decision Americans have to make this year. Do we want to let Republicans enslave women, 1/2 half the populace, or do we want to return to the way things were before Dobbs. I don't have to explain. Very few people on the fence here. What we need are people directly affected by this situation, women of childbearing age, and let them speak, over and over, every day, about all the ways their lives are turned upside down by the direction the Repubs are taking us. No longer trying to take us. There isn't much to argue about here, it's fairly black and white and it is a real division, not one of the bullshit devisions the Repubs have been able to trick the journalists to focus on. # Are there any gutsy NYT op-ed columnists?# Certainly one of the NYT columnists must have noticed that the management is playing a dangerous game with our election.# When are they going to write a column raising the question of how non-transparent the process is, and how dangerous it has become. # Might take a bit of courage to do that, and being willing to put your career on the line, for all of us.# Just asking the question, even if they fired you, seems as big an issue as the question raised by the special prosecutor re Biden's age?# I've been a columnist for a somewhat major publication myself, and I promise you, if I were witnessing what's going on at the NYT, I'd submit the column, and if they didn't run it, I'd offer it to their competitors, and if they wouldn't take it, I'd run it publicly on a blog, and say that they wouldn't run it. # You can't really witness something like this without speaking up. They gave you the platform, you should use it.# Feed cleaning# I'm doing a feed cleanup, unsubbing from broken feeds, and ones that haven't updated since last summer. # There are some people and orgs whose feeds no longer update who I miss. I'm going to call them out here. If your name appears here that means at least one person misses your blogging. Do with that as you may. However if you start blogging, I would be very upset if you didn't let me know the URL of your site or feed. # David Weinberger# Douglas Rushkoff# Eli Pariser# Farhad Manjoo# Fivethirtyeight# Fred Wilson# Heather Cox Richardson (podcast, she may no longer have one)# Jeff Jarvis# Joel Spolsky# Mother Jones podcast# NYT sports feeds all appear to be gone, I think this is probably because they've stopped covering sports?# NYT > Sports > College Basketball# NYT > Sports > College Football# NYT > Sports > Tennis# Blogs I subscribed to for sentimental reasons# One of my RSS test feeds from 2001. # Existential questions# Does openrss.org have a feed? It seems like it should. :-)# Tuesday, February 20, 2024 Journalists like everyone in America should pray President Biden stays healthy, because our only alternative is Putin. And btw in Russia, the non-government-owned news people had to leave, to go into exile. The journalists are playing with fire not just for us, but for themselves too. It's not ridiculous to ring the bells really loud about this because we've already lived through this nightmare once. # Surely there must be people inside the NYT that find this as exhausting as we do. How can we set up a receptacle for leaks from inside the NYT and WP so we can get the truth about who's selling us out to Trump and Putin inside those supposedly great public-serving news orgs? # I don't like Twitter/X -- it's stupid, it already had a perfectly good name. It is what it is. I use Twitter, I don't imagine stopping, certainly not as some kind of demonstration. But it isn't X or Twitter/X. It's just stupid old fucked up Twitter, only now it's fucked for a different reason. I might go for Twitter/F as in Twitter is Fucked thank you very much. And have a nice day. 😄# Ski boot sizing# One thing that's great about ChatGPT is they can help you make a decision in an area you lack expertise and where there is no human you can ask for help making the decision. It's making this human smarter, and it's hard to see the downside of that. # Here's an example. I'm trying to decide whether I should get size 11 rental ski boots or size 11.5. The person behind the counter at the rental place isn't capable of having a long conversation about this, where I get to ask two follow-up questions. # Instead they would say sorry, what size did you say you wanted sir? # The kid isn't thinking about the old dude. 😄 # Monday, February 19, 2024 I've had a recent change of direction. Now I'm factoring into my thinking and planning that there will be a rebirth in blogging, because I see there are people willing to work on making the systems work together in new interesting ways. That's what it's going to take -- we have to capture the imaginations of the smartest web writers. And the only thing that's going to get their attention is developers working together to create new experiences for everyone. Now I believe it's going to happen. # Random thought -- maybe the fastest way to get full ActivityPub support for WordPress is to offer a feature in any WP site to cross-post to a Mastodon gateway operated by Automattic. It's possible I don't understand the problem of course. But Mastodon is open source, so it's not like depending on another vendor to do this for you. And then you avoid all the hassles with having to say what part of the protocol is ActivityPub and what part is Mastodon's API.# Eagle on a tree# This eagle was perched on a tree near my house. # I look forward to dumping Trump again# I've mostly kept Trump off the home page of this blog since he left office in 2021, but things are changing, and this is shaping up as a Trump year. I read today in the NYT that the resistance is exhausted. Bullshit. We're very well rested. Anyway I look forward to once again, pretending Trump doesn't exist, next year or the year after, Murphy-willing. # The other day when I was skiing at Belleayre, I got to ride up on a chairlift with a Trump supporter. He told me he got Covid but it wasn't a big deal, just like a cold. I said a lot of people died from Covid. He said most were already sick or overweight. I said yeah but they deserve to live too. He said he didn't get vaccinated, he doesn't like to put drugs in his body. What bullshit I muttered under my breath. I looked at him, maybe ten years younger than me. From New Jersey, a house painter. I said that my life has been saved by drugs at least twice, once when I was perfectly healthy other than having a ruptured appendix at 9 years old. I also said you're really lucky not to have needed medical care, but before you die I bet you will. And I thought to myself but didn't say out loud that what about your parents and grandparents, siblings even children? Have they all been perfectly healthy until they died? Anyway a chairlift is not a safe place for real anger, but -- you also can't walk away from the other person. There's a lot of soul-sharing on rides like that. # What Trump means by making America great.# Sunday, February 18, 2024 I'm trying out using various social networks to start threads. Still going to use GitHub for serious stuff, but the last few days, some of my posts on Mastodon and Twitter have gotten unexpected interest. Not sure what to attribute it to, some people have theories, but why not just go with the flow. # Threads: "Blogrolls may have seemed silly to outsiders, even to the bloggers of the day, but they were the first step after basic writing on the web (blogs) that led to the social web we're using on Twitter, Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky or Facebook. The blogroll says 'these are the sites and people I follow.'"# I'm looking for an example of a WordPress site that has a block-oriented blogroll on it.# Any billionaire could probably buy Trump now for $500 million, and thus put a bet down on the 2024 election. It could probably payoff 100-to-1 easy. # ChatGPT has been down for me for the last couple of hours. I am really dependent on this thing. # Saturday, February 17, 2024 Hope you like blogrolls, I'm focusing on them for a while. 😄# Yesterday I posted the ChatGPT explainer for blogrolls, but realized later there was an important use of blogrolls it didn't mention. I kept a blogroll on my home page because those were the sites I wanted to check regularly to see what's new. So I was thinking about my own use of my blog, not just helping out sites I support or giving ideas to people who read my blog. Also they didn't provide an illustration of what a blogroll looks like. Here's a snapshot from August 2000, and sure enough, in the left margin, there's the blogroll. Here's a screen shot.# A snapshot from May 2003. The template was redesigned, and there are changes to what's in the blogroll, but it's still there, in the same place. # By August 2004, the blogroll is gone. I don't remember why I took it down, probably because I wasn't using it very much, because by then we had feeds, and Radio UserLand (a feed reader and blogging tool) and the blogroll was just a list, and didn't have any way of telling me in advance that a site had updated. # All of a sudden my posts on Mastodon are getting liked and forwarded a lot more than on the other platforms. What changed? Hmm.# Beatles# My #1 Beatles song these days is Day Tripper. # Most of my listening has been to John Lennon, and more reading. # A lot of his lyrics intentionally mean nothing. # My current infatuation is Gimme Some Truth from Imagine is pretty great because the lyrics are super clear, and quite forceful and beautiful. Of course we want the truth, some of us at least, and you can't tiptoe around that. Most people have arranged their lives so they avoid the truth at all costs. In the end the truth prevails for everyone no matter how hard you try.# Then I saw a quick interview with Ringo and Paul, current day, and Ringo is being kind of a bitch saying that Paul was a workaholic, and he's standing right there, but he isn't disagreeing in fact he's nodding his head, basically saying he likes to do things. # I always wish as a child of their breakup that they had found a way to work together, and for John and George to have their independence from Paul. He definitely took the brunt, but it looks to me like he was desperate to keep the Beatles from breaking up and that brought out his powerful control freak side.# Thing is to people my age, these were our uncles. But maybe there was nothing after The End? Maybe they really were done. We like to believe there was more, but maybe there wasn't. # And of course the people who were Beatles were just people, strangers to us really, we were just projecting our dreams on them. Until the Get Back show, which answered so many of our questions were answered and got us thinking and dreaming again. # Peter Jackson changed the world of 20s as much imho as the Beatles did in the 60s. He did a great thing. # Journalism isn't responsible# There is no organized oversight of journalism. No one whose criticism they respect. And they don't criticize themselves. It's a monopoly, with no reason to change, and that's a formula for a festering mess. Their sense of entitlement is legendary. Such chutzpah. Until it shakes up, we're going to keep getting Trump-size debacles. # They could easily blame their employers for creating Trump. If it weren't for his reality show would his followers see him as anything other than a pathetic East Coast blowhard with a bad combover. Instead they blamed Facebook. Not that FB didn't profit enormously from Trump, but you just can't see the role journalism plays because they can't bite the hand that feeds them. But we can. I don't owe them anything, do you?# BTW it would be incredible to see an investigative report of how the But Her Emails meme was birthed? What does it say about cynicism about the press. Did any journalists hear it? Do any of them feel it?# We feel this. Was journalism paying attention?# Friday, February 16, 2024 What is a blogroll?# I asked ChatGPT to explain.# A blogroll is a list of links to other blogs or websites that a blogger enjoys or finds relevant. It's often found in the sidebar of a blog. The purpose of a blogroll is to share recommendations with readers and to connect with the broader blogging community. By including a blogroll, a blogger can provide their audience with access to additional resources, opinions, or communities that share similar interests. It can also serve as a tool for networking and building relationships with other bloggers, through mutual linking or acknowledgment. Blogrolls were more prominent in the early days of blogging but can still be found on many sites today.# I couldn't improve on that, so I published it as-is.# Thursday, February 15, 2024 I thought ChatGPT could make a movie for me, so I sketched one out. "I'd like a video showing a middle-aged man skiing down an intermediate slope, looking excellent and confident. It's sunny and there are bumps on the hill, and a few other skiers on the side of the slope with expressions of astonishment that such an old person can be such a snazzy skier." Instead of making the video for me, it wrote a creative plan for me. That wasn't what I had in mind! 😄# Skiing is falling# I went skiing again today, second time in two weeks. Feeling pretty good. And I learned something I'd like to share. A different way of looking at skiing. Here's the story...# First thing in the morning the snow was hard and while they had done a good job of grooming, you do a lot of sliding when you edge when the snow is so hard. Much more than in the powder you get in the Rockies. So I'm always totally thinking about staying in control and it's stressful. In this mode I ask myself why I'm doing this if it's so unpleasant. # But as the snow softened during the day, and my body warmed up, and my brain remembered more about this strange thing that I used to do so well, I started going faster, not worrying as much, and then started going faster, and I started feeling like wow I'm doing this well, and then boom, for an instant I completely lost control and was tilted one way, but had to land the other way, and without any conscious thought and absolutely no time to worry, my brain and body did exactly what you have to do to make this look and feel super elegant, almost as if I must have planned it this way. # I kept skiing a bit after that and then stopped and breathed the cold air, and looked at another ski area far in the distance (Hunter?) and realized something -- skiing is falling. You go to a mountain top, pull down your goggles, get to the top of some steepness, and you jump. The question is -- do you look and feel beautiful while doing it, or are you scared and trying to stay in control. But that's the thing, falling is all about letting it go and trusting your mind and body will know what to do when you fall one way, and also when you fall another. # Wednesday, February 14, 2024 I've taken to cross-posting to various social media accounts, by opening a new window, creating the post in one service's little text box, and then opening tabs for each of the others and copy-pasting. Twitter, Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, Facebook. I'm getting good at it. Yesterday I did that with the piece about President Biden and how he probably would rather be doing anything than be President, for a mostly thankless country, at age 81. I imagine he has great-grandchildren he'd like to get to know. Maybe a book or two to read, maybe one to write. To get his affairs in order. At age 68 I'm trying to shed responsibility as much as possible. It's prudent, and has a point. When I was 25 I wanted to take over the world. Now I'd just like to feel good. As you get older you are capable of more depth of feeling, in some ways, and grow more numb in others. I spent time with my father at 80, his last year. He was always a curious man, wanting to learn about anything new, but in his last days he wasn't curious. No ambition. But he seemed okay with it, even happy at times (possibly due in part to the morphine he was allowed). Anyway, it's always interesting to see where people react to what among the different social web networks. And in this case, the most flow came from Mastodon, by far. I would not have predicted that. And it's good to see, that interesting ideas and perspective may have more of a future outside the networks operated by the billionaire tech companies. # Tuesday, February 13, 2024 The News tab on the Scripting News home page was set up to request the All category from my FeedLand account. I switched to Tech, it's a bit faster, and probably a better fit. Still looking for a performance issue. # If you're thinking it might be good if President Biden stepped aside for someone younger and nicer to look at, what you really want is President Biden to be younger and nicer looking, and of course he probably wouldn't mind that either. But, as Keith Olbermann spells out so well in his latest Countdown, if he were to step aside that would basically concede the election to Trump. So if you think the old man is being silly and vain, well, he's being a lot smarter than you are, and btw, paying a huge price. If you live to be 81, I bet the last thing you want to do, after the life he's had, is to be in this position. We should get behind him, and tell him so, let him know we don't want anyone else, and we want him to be happy, healthy and know that the smart, good people of the US appreciate what he's doing for all of us. # I was happy to see Jon Stewart back on the Daily Show. I wish he would get over how he looks, all of us have aged in the time since he was last on the Daily Show. It was really good. He finally is back with the writers he belongs with, and this show obviously agrees with him, and I got the feeling I always used to get from his show "we'll figure this out." # The next hurdle for AI is to teach the software to learn about you. I think that's what we all want. Start with the simplest things. This is my coding style, so give me all the example code you generate this way. Where does this end? No idea. But read Klara and the Sun, a truly great story, beautifully told, for a truly creative application. # This is what I imagine we all yearn for, for someone to really know us before we die. Okay if it can't be other people, at least let it be a machine. Something like preserving a brain. Wouldn't it be great to know that when you're gone, the essential you, even if it doesn't include your consciousness, persists? You could visit a person like you visit a website. This is just evolutionary, and it's obviously going to happen. # Today would be the perfect day to ski at Belleayre or Hunter, if you can get out of NYC where all the snow is falling. I have work to do and was planning on skiing tomorrow, expecting 8 inches of fresh snow. We're not getting much from this storm in the Catskills, NYC is getting the brunt. And any day you can't get here from the city means not many people on the mountain. 😄# A powerful blogroll!# I'd like a fanciful cartoon drawing of a blogroll that automatically sorts itself out when something new comes in. It's happy and fun but also very powerful!# Monday, February 12, 2024 The best SuperBowl ad according to my stringent quality standards was Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, proving that comedy isn't hard, just have people reacting to stupid stuff in ridiculous self-destructive ways. Physical comedy for some reasons is ROTFL funny. They can do this because everyone knows and loves their delicious product and while it isn't good for you, it won't kill you either. And the announcer is Bojack Horseman, so you know that's pretty cool too. # Big snowstorm coming in tonight. And working on some interesting new software. That's about all for now. # The SuperBowl last night was an excellent sports game. I didn't like all the bullshit, but it was good sport. However it's all about gambling. I bet it's ruining a lot of lives. A way of sucking the last pennies from people who are already struggling. And it's so easy, just get an app for your phone, add your credit card, and give them all your money.# The Niners didn't win but Taylor Swift did, that's good enough for me. # There's a chain of beating hearts connecting back in time from you to a fish that crawled onto land, one of your many ancestors (assuming you believe in evolution, I guess). Actually, even if you don't believe. 😄# Just give me some truth# I just found myself writing in a tweet on Threads that the news industry has contempt for its readers that AI tools don't have. # Actually the AIs also have a way better attitude about the truth than Wikipedia does (yes I know Wikipedia is a Ouija board, that the very worst people control).# We weren't worried about the rise of fascism and the destruction of our ecology, but we were worried about preserving jobs for supposed truth-tellers who think we deserve garbage and don't disappoint. # # For ten points, who was the Tricky Dicky he was singing about?# Sunday, February 11, 2024 I'm almost rooting for KC just so Taylor can be the total dominant uncontested Queen of America.# If the Supreme Court had an ounce of guts they would say this isn't a state matter, it's a federal matter, and we are the federal government, so here's the deal. Trump tried to overthrow the government and he took an oath to protect the government, and therefore the 14th Amendment applies, and he can't be on the ballot anywhere, including Colorado.# Where did RSS being D come from? The meme was started by VCs and tech influencers in the 00s. A bunch of VCs had RSS startups, hired people who didn't know anything about it to run the companies. # Today's song: How Deep is Your Love?# One way is always better than two# Most Hacker News threads devolve into people talking about personalities, not about tech stuff. But yesterday's thread about OPML was the rare exception, until someone who says they like me (I guess) said something personal and ugly. # I wonder why after all this time we can't see how pointless it is to have opinions about people, esp online. Everything you hear is passed through someone else's filters, so you're getting a huge dose of their personality along with a sliver of insight into the person they're talking about. # And don't forget to factor in that sometimes when someone has put an obstacle in the way of big companies, you can earn favor inside those companies by scandalizing the person whose work they object to. There was a lot of that happening as RSS crossed paths with some very big and rich companies with lots of employees, and an interest in appearing to interop without the cost of interop.# I've tried to add formats, protocols and software to the mix, always trying to compromise. It's not mentioned in the Wikipedia page on RSS that I had a format that does what RSS does, a year before it existed, but I gave it up so that Netscape and UserLand would build on the same format, RSS. # I didn't invent RSS. I did something much greater, I compromised. We had the leading blogging software at the time, and Netscape had the feeds of four credible news orgs. When you put them together, that turned out to be huge power. We eventually pulled in all of social media and all of professional publishing into one format. Ask anyone who was active at the time. The blogging world adopted RSS in an instant, in 1999 and 2000. And in 2002, when the NYT adopted it, again, in an instant the entire news world all of a sudden all had RSS feeds. You can see it in the steady stream of announcements in the archive of this blog. # BTW there was someone brilliant at Netscape who saw our compromise and responded with more compromise. Their next version of RSS had some of the features we had left behind in our format. We never asked them to do that, they just figured it out. Collaboration is something that requires two, one person can't collaborate on their own. I know that sounds ridiculous, but sometimes people don't look for the other party who made compromise possible.# I don't think even the people who were closest to it at the time understood the move. And I don't think very many appreciate the power that comes from being the one who throws in the towel on their pet project to attain unity. # One way of doing something is always better than two. That's just a restatement of Postel's Postulate. Be conservative in what you send. # That doesn't just apply to you, it applies to all of us collectively. Every time you add something that already exists we're all going to pay for it. # If you think that saying this makes me cantankerous -- well, I say okay -- but you're wrong because it's generous and brilliant to push back when people add complexity. Of course people don't like to hear they're doing something wrong, but when it comes to accumulating complexity debt unnecessarily, well imho you have to listen to that. Complexity is a force against interop. # We should be looking for opportunities to work together to create something greater than anything any one of us can create. # See also: the role of prior art in design.# Saturday, February 10, 2024 Steven Levy asked an interesting question on Bluesky or Threads, can't remember which. Would I feel differently if I knew a work of art that I found inspiring was created by an AI. At first I said no, because what matters in art is how it is received, not how it was created. What effect did it have on the viewer. That's the art. But then I remembered that when I found out that Wordle was edited by a human, that the words were chosen by a person not at random, I found the game less interesting, because certain words obviously would be eliminated from consideration, even though they are in the dictionary and are used in normal writing and speech. I found myself guessing at who the editor is, and that's not why I play Wordle. I don't know why, but understanding this person isn't it. # Trump is treated by Big News the way they cover climate change, with a big shrug, what can we do. Meanwhile, they get all twisted up in Her Emails and the like.# I enjoy blocking “top contributors“ on Facebook who respond with sarcasm to requests for help.# A WordPress namespace?# Thinking out loud. # It would be interesting if every feed for a wordpress.com site included the site_ID of the site an item came from, and if every item had the ID of the item it came from. Shorten the distance from seeing something that needs editing to actually being able to edit it. # This was one of the big realizations of Edit This Page in 1999. # A WordPress-aware reader might be able to do something with this. Or if it knew that the user owned the site it came from, it could open it in a simple editor. # I was thinking through a use-case and came across this idea. # Isn't it time for there to be a WordPress namespace? After all it's not only a big part of the web, it's also a big part of the feed world. # Friday, February 9, 2024 The US government is incapable of defending itself. The tools are in the Constitution. Clearly, even if Trump loses, we're going to go through the same insurrection bullshit only this time around they'll be more practiced and determined. Our ancestors foresaw this event and provided for it. Speaking for them, after listening to the audio from yesterday's Supreme Court hearing, how could it be any more obvious this guy can't be given a second chance. You (Supreme Court) have a job to do. You're the only ones who can judge whether the former President violated his oath, the one you gave him if you recall (John Roberts). I think it was set up that way so you'd get the point that you're the one who has to hold him to his oath. Now if you won't do it, step aside, and you all keep stepping aside until someone has the guts to stand up for the country and its Constitution. Tell the Repubs to nominate someone else because this dude broke his oath and as the 14th Amendment says so freaking clearly, he can't serve again. How does it make sense to give him the same oath again when he violated it in such a craven way last time. If we as a country can't come together for this, then we don't deserve to survive.# If you have a new trend in tech, the absolute worst way to promote it is as a replacement for existing layers of tech with huge installed bases. You can't win that kind of comparison. Installed bases generally don't disappear, and if they do, it happens very slowly. You almost certainly don't have the replacement, but you might have a useful product that would appeal to people, so be smart and explain it that way, if you just happen to boil the ocean with it, you can thank your luck because that's what actually happened. # In other words you can't just wish something like the web into existence, you can't plan it, or architect it or envision it. It happens on its own. Look at all the time and energy TBL put into reinventing the web. Never happened, and he's the guy who got the web started in the first place. I've been there when something small became huge and real, twice actually. But I couldn't tell you why, I just have theories. I called it "media hacking" at the time. Create a new media type and put it out there to see if it would stick. After a while nothing would stick because the pipes were controlled by Twitter, Google and Facebook and they weren't sharing. Now we're kind of letting Facebook own the pipes Twitter used to own. Maybe. So many people appear to be fooled into thinking FB is doing something open. They should learn the rules of tech, it's nowhere near as complicated as football or basketball. If everyone wants to interop with one company, nothing open can come out of that. Threads became the thing people wanted to interop with a couple of days after it came into existence. Now it must be orders of magnitude greater than Mastodon, and it's not going to hit any scaling walls because they've already scaled it, in every way. There's still time, I think, for new ideas, but maybe not much time. We'll see. # Thursday, February 8, 2024 What tool would you use to create and edit a blogroll?# When I was your age, if you're in your late teens or early 20s, there was nothing remotely like Apple Music or Spotify. If we wanted to listen to a specific album we'd have to buy a copy of the vinyl record at a music store. I used to go to a store called Mushroom Too, on Broadway and Zimpel in New Orleans. It was kind of like a head shop, smelled of incense, and they had a great sound system and they were always playing good music. It was on the second floor above a bar called The Boot that had the usual college stuff, beer, burgers, pinball. The record store had rows of racks of albums, like a library in a way, and you'd wander around looking for bands you knew or had heard about, and you'd stare at album covers, front and back and try to decide. Looking for "something good to listen to." And you could only afford a certain number every year, so you listened to each album a lot. I don't know if it works that way for young folk today. In 50 years when you're looking back will you know the songs in the order they appeared on the album? I never bought singles, by the time I came along album rock was the thing, stations like WNEW and WPLJ in New York. I'd listen to the student station at Tulane, WTUL. They'd play longer songs, and not always the most popular song on an album. You got the sense that the DJ was being creative with the songs they chose. BTW, both Mushroom and The Boot are still there. What a trip. # There was also a local station that was like KFOG in the Bay Area, can't remember its name. And of course like everyone everywhere I listened to Dr Demento. # Later, when I was a grad student in Madison, I lived in a house with nine roommates. We shared lots of stuff, including our record collections and all of a sudden new music worlds opened to me, including (memorably) Bonnie Raitt, Little Feat, Talking Heads and Saturday Night Fever (which I'm listening to as I write this). # Jury duty is self-government# Jury duty is an intensive bootcamp for American democracy.# The great thing about jury duty is you get a very clear sense of what self-government is about. It makes you feel empowered which can be even more uncomfortable than feeling powerless.# So much of the frenetic activity online is about that sense of powerlessness. So we give money to causes or we join in boycotts, but these aren't as powerful as participating in governing. Jury duty is a very quick way to do that.# We have to act more like citizens and less like subjects. I think that's the real message of the election of 2016. Subjects elect someone like Trump. People who think like citizens would elect someone very different.# I wrote this on Facebook on this day in 2017. #
