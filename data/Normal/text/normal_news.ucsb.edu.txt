Why are we all so enraptured? One insight that emerges is the ability of weather to bring us together. As something that literally impacts every person on the planet, it's a global shared experience. And that fosters a sense of connection, be it while filling sandbags before a storm or bantering at a party about the lovely weather we're having today. That sensibility underlies many of the features you'll find here, from our look at the current state of democracy to the documentary photography of Richard Ross. Each, in their own way, speaks to the power of connection to heal, to uplift and to unite.
