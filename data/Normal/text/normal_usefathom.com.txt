We have a fair billing policy and let you know when it's time to upgrade (based on a 2-month rolling average of pageviews and events).What does Fathom Analytics do with my data?We make it easily accessible to you, and that’s it. We don’t mine your data, sell it, use it for retargeting, or have any interest in it other than keeping it available for you. We sell our software, not data.How long does Fathom Analytics keep my data?Forever. Our data retention policy for all customers on all plans is that we never delete your data. Unlike most other analytics companies who keep your data for 30 days to 5 years (i.e. not long at all), Fathom Analytics retains your data to view your dashboard forever. As long as you're a paying customer, your data is available to you forever.Is Fathom Analytics free?If you aren’t paying for the product, you are the product. Google Analytics is free, so the data you collect for them about your website visitors is the product. They’re an advertising company and make billions by knowing as much as possible about all of us. That’s why we charge a reasonable price for our software (we don’t have to or want to sell data).Is there a better alternative to Google Analytics?Of course, and you’re looking at it! Google Analytics is problematic on several fronts: they killed off their most popular product (UA) and are legally risky in several countries where Data Protection Authorities have found the use of Google Analytics to be legally risky. Whereas Fathom Analytics is a better alternative to Google Analytics—we're lightning fast, more accurate, and fully align with the GDPR and the ePrivacy directive.Why is Fathom Analytics better than EU-only providers?As per the GDPR (Schrems II ruling), “EU visitor data has to be processed in the EU on servers provided by an EU hosting provider or a hosting provider with an adequacy ruling”. This is exactly what we do for EU visitors. But that doesn’t mean visitor data from everywhere else should be processed in the EU, as that slows everything down. That’s why we intelligently route visitor data to multiple locations worldwide, not just the EU.Is Fathom Analytics GDPR compliant?Fathom Analytics is GDPR compliant by design. The fundamental goal of the GDPR regulation is to protect the privacy and personal data of people in the EU. With everything we do, we ask ourselves whether it poses any risk to our customers’ website visitors. We also have a lawful basis for the processing we do and we run privacy risk assessments and GDPR audits.Have more questions?
