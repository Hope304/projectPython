Read more About Cookiedatabase.org Cookiedatabase.org is a project that started in 2019, and that wants to bring more transparency in the online world of website tracking and collecting personal data.Almost everybody gets targeted through the use of cookies and other online techniques. Often, the function and the duration they stay active are unknown to websitevisitors.We want to change this by describing the consequences for data privacy, per service, and per cookie. To do this, we continually research and moderate cookie details and the services that place these cookies.In the first two weeks since the start of the project, more than 5000 different cookies were added by our users! Developing the Data passportsIn the second stage of the project (2021), we wanted to understand what a company actually knows about website visitors when combining the data they get from different cookies and services. This is why we created the Data Passports. They are based on the information from public sources, such as the privacystatement of a vendor. Sponsoring and partnershipsThis project is financially supported by Complianz, a Privacy Suite for WordPress, and by SIDN Fund, a Dutch foundation focussing on user empowerment and an inviolable internet for all.We are always open to new sponsor proposals, or to organizations that want to cooperate with us in other (non-financial) ways, in order to keep cookiedatabase.org up to date and available for free. Using Cookiedatabase.orgBy using the search function, everybody can use the data from the cookie database. The database also makes it possible to translate the descriptions of the cookies in all languages.The data in the cookie database can be used freely under the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives-4.0-International License. 1 + Contributed Cookies 10000 + Synced Websites 1 + Services Contact Do you have extra information about a service or cookie?
