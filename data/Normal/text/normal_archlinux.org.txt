Arch Linux Arch Linux Home Packages Forums Wiki GitLab Security AUR Download A simple, lightweight distribution You've reached the website for Arch Linux, a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple. Currently we have official packages optimized for the x86-64 architecture. We complement our official package sets with a community-operated package repository that grows in size and quality each and every day. Our strong community is diverse and helpful, and we pride ourselves on the range of skillsets and uses for Arch that stem from it. Please check out our forums and mailing lists to get your feet wet.

Latest News mkinitcpio hook migration and early microcode 2024-03-04 With the release of mkinitcpio v38, several hooks previously provided by Arch packages have been moved to the mkinitcpio upstream project. The hooks are: systemd, udev, encrypt, sd-encrypt, lvm2 and mdadm_udev. To ensure no breakage of users' setup occurs, temporary conflicts have been introduced into the respective packages to prevent installing packages that are no longer compatible. The following packages needs to be upgraded together: mkinitcpio 38-3 systemd 255.4-2 lvm2 2.03.23-3 mdadm 4.3-2 cryptsetup 2.7.0-3 Please note that the mkinitcpio flag --microcode, and the microcode option in the preset files, has been deprecated in favour of a new microcode hook. This also allows you to drop the microcode initrd lines from your boot configuration as they are now packed together with the main initramfs image. Making dbus-broker our default D-Bus daemon 2024-01-09 We are making dbus-broker our default implementation of D-Bus, for improved performance, reliability and integration with systemd. For the foreseeable future we will still support the use of dbus-daemon, the previous implementation. Pacman will ask you whether to install dbus-broker-units or dbus-daemon-units. We recommend picking the default. For a more detailed rationale, please see our RFC 25. Bugtracker migration to GitLab completed 2023-12-03 We are happy to announce that the migration of the bugtracker to GitLab is done! ðŸ¥³ Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration! This means the issue tracker and merge requests on the GitLab package repos are now enabled. The old bugtracker will subsequently be closed down. For archiving reasons there will be a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked Task #56716) are still stable, migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab. Packaging bugs are now opened on the repo hosting the corresponding packaging sources, the "Add â€¦ Incoming changes in JDK / JRE 21 packages may require manual intervention 2023-11-02 We are introducing a change in JDK/JRE packages of our distro. This is triggered from the way a JRE is build in modern versions of Java (>9). We are introducing this change in Java 21. To sum it up instead of having JDK and JRE packages coexist in the same system we will be making them conflict. The JDK variant package includes the runtime environment to execute Java applications so if one needs compilation and runtime of Java they need only the JDK package in the future. If, on the other hand, they need just runtime of Java then JRE â€¦ Changes to default password hashing algorithm and umask settings 2023-09-22 With shadow >= 4.14.0, Arch Linux's default password hashing algorithm changed from SHA512 to yescrypt. Furthermore, the umask settings are now configured in /etc/login.defs instead of /etc/profile. This should not require any manual intervention. Reasons for Yescrypt The password-based key derivation function (KDF) and password hashing scheme yescrypt has been chosen due to its adoption (readily available in libxcrypt, which is used by pam) and its stronger resilience towards password cracking attempts over SHA512. Although the winner of the Password Hashing Competition has been argon2, this algorithm is not yet available in libxcrypt â€¦ Older News 2023-08-19 ansible-core >= 2.15.3-1 update may require manual intervention 2023-08-11 budgie-desktop >= 10.7.2-6 update requires manual intervention 2023-06-18 TeX Live package reorganization 2023-06-14 OpenBLAS >= 0.3.23-2 update requires manual intervention 2023-05-21 Git migration completed 2023-05-15 Git migration announcement 2023-02-12 Switch to the base-devel meta package requires manual intervention 2023-01-13 PHP 8.2 update and introduction of legacy branch 2023-01-12 In memory of Jonathon Fernyhough 2022-09-23 Removing python2 from the repositories Package Search: Recent Updates (more) python-sentinels 1.0.0-10 any ibus-m17n 1.4.28-1 x86_64 python-ziafont 0.7-2 any python-sortedcontainers 2.4.0-5 any python-wsproto 1.2.0-3 any python-pyte 0.8.2-2 any python-wstools 0.4.10-7 any python-pipreqs 0.4.13-2 any haskell-hadrian 0.1.0.0+9.4.8-1 x86_64 wayvnc 0.8.0-1 x86_64 system76-firmware 1.0.59-1 x86_64 rtmpdump 1:2.4.r105.6f6bb13-1 x86_64 lightdm-gtk-greeter 1:2.0.9-1 x86_64 tomcat9 9.0.86-1 any tomcat8 8.5.99-1 any Documentation Wiki Manual Pages Installation Guide Community Mailing Lists IRC Channels Planet Arch International Communities Support Donate Products via Unixstickers T-shirts via Freewear T-shirts via HELLOTUX Tools Mirrorlist Updater Mirror List Mirror Status Development Getting involved Projects in Git Developer Wiki Package Groups Todo Lists ISO Release List Visualizations Differences Reports People Developers Package Maintainers Support Staff Developer Fellows Package Maintainer Fellows Support Staff Fellows Signing Master Keys More Resources Press Coverage Logos & Artwork News Archives RSS Feeds Copyright Â© 2002-2024 Judd Vinet, Aaron Griffin and Levente PolyÃ¡k.
