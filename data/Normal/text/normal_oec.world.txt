But these estimates can be biased against geographically isolated economies.Multidimensional approaches to economic complexity solve this problem by combining data on international trade, patents, and research papers. They combine to provide better estimates of economic complexity that have an improved ability to explain international variations in economic growth, income inequality, and greenhouse gas emissions. You can explore the latest multidimensional economic complexity rankings at the OEC.ECI TradeThis is the traditional economic complexity index. It is based on the geography of trade and captures the sophistication of a country's exports.Trade ECI estimates a country's ability to produce and export complex products that require a high level of knowledge and skills.1Japan2.062Switzerland1.943Chinese Taipei1.934South Korea1.825Germany1.816Singapore1.747Czechia1.568Sweden1.549Austria1.5010United States1.46ECI TechnologyUsing patent applications by technology, we can measure the complexity expressed in the geography of patent applications.Tech ECI showcases a nation's ability to produce complex patentable innovations.1Sweden1.562Germany1.553Austria1.504Finland1.385Italy1.346Norway1.337France1.248Turkey1.239Spain1.2310Switzerland1.22ECI ResearchWe can estimate the complexity of a country’s scientific output using data on scientific publications by field of research.Research ECI estimates the sophistication of a country's academic research, and together with trade and tech ECI, helps explain the intensity of emissions.1United States2.412United Kingdom2.313Canada2.144Australia2.085Netherlands2.076Switzerland1.937Sweden1.928Germany1.879Belgium1.8010Israel1.76Explore RankingsBuild Custom VisualizationsWith the Observatory of Economic Complexity, you can build millions of custom visualizations.
