Just like every actual house has its address (which includes the number, the name of the street, city, etc), every single point on the surface of earth can be specified by the latitude and longitude coordinates. Therefore, by using latitude and longitude we can specify virtually any point on earth. The latitude has the symbol of phi, and it shows the angle between the straight line in the certain point and the equatorial plane. The latitude is specified by degrees, starting from 0° and ending up with 90° to both sides of the equator, making latitude Northern and Southern. The equator is the line with 0° latitude. The longitude has the symbol of lambda and is another angular coordinate defining the position of a point on a surface of earth. The longitude is defined as an angle pointing west or east from the Greenwich Meridian, which is taken as the Prime Meridian. The longitude can be defined maximum as 180° east from the Prime Meridian and 180° west from the Prime Meridian. Both latitude and longitude are measured in degrees, which are in turn divided into minutes and seconds. For example, the tropical zone which is located to the south and to the north from the Equator is determined by the limits of 23°26'13.7'' S and 23°26'13.7'' N. Or. For example, the geographical coordinates of the mount Ngauruhoe in New Zealand, famous with its being the filming area for the Lord of the Rings movie, has the geographic coordinates of 39°09'24.6''S 175°37'55.8''E. About Lat Long Latlong.net is an online geographic tool that can be used to lookup latitude and longitude of a place, and get its coordinates on map. You can search for a place using a city's or town's name, as well as the name of special places, and the correct lat long coordinates will be shown at the bottom of the latitude longitude finder form. At that, the place you found will be displayed with the point marker centered on map. Also the gps coordinates will be displayed below the map.

Thank you so much and your hard work into creating this website is acknowledged.-3 ReplyJulie 2022-12-10 15:32:20 Why are the lat long coordinates different from the GPS coordinates? I would think that 42.982460N latitude would translate to GPS 42degrees 98'2460"N but it comes up below the map as 42degrees 58'56.856"N.-4 ReplyOli 2023-12-15 13:13:31 This is because a Degree is split into 60 minutes and these are split into 60 seconds, whereas 42.982460 is a decimal version. You can convert by multiplying the decimal remainder by 60 for minutes, then seconds. 0.982460 * 60 = 58.9476 (58 minutes) AND 0.9476 * 60 = 56.856 (seconds)Anna 2022-11-30 19:29:34 The software is amazing, but please add the option to create more than one order at the same time.

Now I send it off to Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre and take to the police. Judging by the home, they don't need my anything from me. As a single mom with no family, and unable to work from an accident where someone was intoxicated rear ended me I have nothing he could steal except the very small amount Insurance Disability gives. This has caused so much stress knowing as I type this he/she is watching. Google Gmail is how they got in. You cannot sign in or out of Gmail and its an open door for hackers. Googles response, delete Gmail from phone and tablet and use the computer. Google was attacked by phishing (sp)and secured their employees with a stick. But we're told delete our Gmail. How hard is it to build a sign in and out button? They certianally have enough apps to help hackers download apps that are completly hidden and 1Password by Google....thanks! I was in surgery and my phone was dead in recovery room and 181 texts were sent. Be careful, I've spoken to a lot of people and free wifi even bluetooth can let them in. Its worth the money to get a VPN instead of going through what I am. They have pictures of my kids and where they go to school and all my documents that no one wants a hacker to see. My health is declining fast and I have to contact the Government to make sure that everything is ok so my kids can safely get money once I'm gone and not him. Thank you for this, I can hand it over to police and Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.-1 ReplyEditor 2022-09-19 07:28:26 Hi Melinda, We are so sorry to hear that. We hope that never happens again.

I had to geocode over 200 cities. I double-checked them (since it is critical these coordinates are correct), and while most were right a few dozen were wrong. The "wrong" coordinates were offset by one so that the coordinates for a given city were given to the city before or after where it should have gone. Since I couldn't trust the data I ended up having to geocode all my data manually.2 ReplyEditor 2022-03-04 14:46:59 Hello, thanks for using latlong.net.
