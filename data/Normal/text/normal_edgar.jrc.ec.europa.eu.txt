EDGAR provides independent emission estimates compared to what reported by European Member States or by Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), using international statistics and a consistent IPCC methodology. EDGAR provides both emissions as national totals and gridmaps at 0.1 x 0.1 degree resolution at global level, with yearly, monthly and up to hourly data. INSIGHTS GHG Emissions and Climate Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on natural resources, the world economy and human health. It will lead to increased temperatures, rising sea levels and increased frequencies of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. INSIGHTS Air and Toxic pollutants Despite continued efforts to reduce emissions of harmful air pollutants, air pollution remains a worldwide concern, including in large areas of Europe. INSIGHTS GHGs from the food systems Food system involves all economic sectors and makes a significant contribution to total anthropogenic GHGs emissions. Understanding the various components is a necessary precursor to the design and implementation of actionable and efficient mitigation measures for the system. TOOLS Country Fact Sheet Gain insights by country on historical and target emissions, national climate commitments. Scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal.
