In my professional and personal opinion, Gold Dust is the exceptional choice for a Restorative Dental Lab.Dr. Sam Cress ‘‘The relationship I developed with Gold Dust has changed my life and practice forever. I feel it has allowed me to take my practice to the next level by their quality work and vast array of resources to enhance my practice. Gold Dust has honestly become a synergistic part of my practice and they are the only lab I use.Dr. Valerie Warren ‘‘I’ve been using Gold Dust exclusively for the last 10 years since I started my office and they are the only lab I use. The first veneer case I did was with them, and it was on my father. Gold Dust’s attention to detail was just unsurpassed. Since then it’s been a perfect relationship!Dr. Mary Viechnicki ‘‘We all have people in our lives that are instrumental to our success. Today, without a doubt, it was proved that using an extraordinary dental lab can truly reduce stress and be so influential and contributory to the success of not just a single case but future patients. My assistant and I today were in complete awe and disbelief how life-like, natural, and beautiful these crowns just dropped right in with ZERO adjustments!!!Dr. Farokh Jiveh ‘‘What I value most about my relationship with a laboratory is the personal connection, which I definitely receive with Gold Dust. They are committed to excellence, they want me to succeed, they want the case to succeed and I feel they are in it for the long run.
