Featured Article: Antonio Vivaldi Probable portrait of Vivaldi, 1723c. 1723Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (March 4, 1678 – July 28, 1741) was an Italian composer, virtuoso violinist, and impresario of Baroque music. He was regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers. He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom, which was paramount in the development of Johann Sebastian Bach's instrumental music. Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as The Four Seasons. Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Pietà, a home for abandoned children.
