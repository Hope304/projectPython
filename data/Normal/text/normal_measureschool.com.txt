This has expanded our service offerings and provided additional revenue for us and clients." Darren Cart, MDAgency Owner, nycsem.com "MeasureSchool is the best resource on the internet for marketers that need to get technical with analytics!​​" Francesco CifardiFounder, Aurea Stratego "Julian’s Content added a skill set to my resume that got me my job. I was a BA/PM with an interest in analytics and when my team initiated an analytics offering to our clients I combined this course while working alongside the implementation agency. When they left I took over without missing a step. Seriously, I started out not knowing anything about GTM/GA, and now I am now managing a GTM/GA Premium account with dozens of clients.
