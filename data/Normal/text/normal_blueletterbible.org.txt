Lambert Dolphin Read More New Items Amplified Bible Now Available on BLB! We are constantly receiving requests for different resources, tools, and even Bible versions from our users. One of the most common requests is that we add the Amplified Bible (AMP) to our library of translations. It was obvious to us that it was something our users greatly desired to have on the site. And so, we are pleased to announce that we now offer the AMP on Blue Letter Bible. The first full version of the AMP was completed in 1965. After fifty years had passed, significant changes in both the style and usage of the English language had been made. With this in mind, the Lockman Foundation revisited this well-loved translation of God's Word and began to revise it. This eventually led to the release of the new Amplified Bible in 2015. We at Blue Letter Bible believe that this translation will be an amazing resource for our users. The expanded text provides clarification on the meaning of Scripture while remaining faithful and true to the original text. In fact, the AMP focuses on including certain phrases from the original manuscripts that do not flow well in most English translations. We want to thank our friends at the Lockman Foundation for their permission to provide this version to our users. They are long-time friends and partners of the ministry, and we are blessed by their generosity. To learn more about the Amplified Bible, we highly recommend reading the version's preface on our site and the information page on Lockman Foundation's website. New User Testimonial Video Compilation Last year, we released a compilation of user-submitted videos that detailed their experience with Blue Letter Bible. It was so moving for us as a ministry to see our users blessed by the resources and tools that God allows us to provide. With that in mind, we asked again for more submissions. And you all answered! Because of the generous time you took to submit testimonials, we were able to put together another video compilation for all to watch. We hope everyone who sees it will be as encouraged by what these people have to say as we were. If you have not had the chance to watch the first one, it can be found on our YouTube channel or by clicking HERE. If you would like to submit your own video testimonial, we would love to watch it! Just go to our page on Testimonial.io and record it from your device. If you need assistance or would like more information, please contact us at testimonials@blueletterbible.org. To learn more about Blue Letter Bible, visit our History of BLB or About BLB pages. May God bless your time in His Word! Read More Smith & Van Dyck Arabic Translation Now on BLB! Blue Letter Bible has been blessed by God to reach all corners of the world with our tools and resources. It is immensely humbling to be used in such a significant manner for the spread of God's gospel. Thusly, our ministry has desired to provide as many international and multilingual resources as possible. With that desire to expand our resources to include additional languages, we are excited to add the Smith & Van Dyck Arabic translation to our version library. Work on this translation began back in the mid-1800s by Reverend Eli Smith. After thoroughly studying and learning the Arabic language, Smith began an effort to translate the entire Bible into Arabic in 1848. By 1851, the Syria Mission was fully supporting Smith's efforts. Though he completed translating a vast majority of the Bible, Smith sadly passed away in 1857 after nine years of work. Shortly thereafter, the mission appointed Dr. Van Dyck to continue the work. The translation had come under the purview of the American Bible Society, however, which according to the Arabic Bible Outreach Ministry website, "required a strict adherence to the Textus Receptus of Hahn's Greek Testament." This led to Van Dyck revising every verse in the New Testament, using the basis left by Smith to engage in re-translation. He also translated the remaining books from the Old Testament, consisting mainly of the prophetic books. He completed his work on August 22, 1864. The complete Arabic Bible went to print in March of the next year, nearly two decades after Smith began the work in the 1840s. It is so amazing to see how God had His hand upon this thoughtful translation. To learn more about the Smith & Van Dyck Arabic translation, we highly recommend reading the history of the translation at the official Arabic Bible Outreach Ministry website.
