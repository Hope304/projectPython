Britt@OrchestormA little under two years ago I installed @dayoneapp, initially to keep a pandemic journal. It wasn’t long until I realized how beneficial is to write about my personal life as well! This is my favorite app. I use it everyday, if 72,000 words wasn’t telling enough 😂 Julia@_AppForThat_Constant source of joy: @dayoneapp’s “On this Day” feature which offers up memories from years past. I’m looking forward to these every day and it’s a great motivator to journal about all the big (and small) things that matter to me on any given day. Paul Adkins@malvernian@dayoneapp 10 years to the day since downloading Day One. 3,857 entries & no days missed! Todd Utterback@tsmellsI’ve journaled with @dayoneapp for 10+ years(!!), & I’m currently riding a 1,469 day journaling streak 🌊🏄‍♂️ (thats 4+ years of daily 🖊📸!). It’s an essential app, & there’s no better time to try it out! Jason Tabeling@jtabelingThe amount of times I pull out @dayoneappto answer the question…”When did we” or “where were we when” is amazing. 10 years digital yearbook and counting. im.THAT.mom@ragemom2020Damn @dayoneapp that text feature is amazing!
