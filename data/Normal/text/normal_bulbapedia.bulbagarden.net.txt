Main Page From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia. Jump to navigationJump to search Welcome to Bulbapedia! the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia Bulbapedia is an encyclopedia about Pokémon to which anyone can contribute. Since its launch in February 2005, it has grown to become one of the largest Pokémon resources on the internet. As part of Bulbagarden, this ever-growing wiki is supported by the Bulbagarden Archives, the Bulbagarden forums and the Bulbagarden Discord. You're welcome to browse for a while, if you wish, or make an account to start editing pages. We have 52,588 articles on a range of Pokémon-related topics. If you have any questions, first see the FAQ page. If this doesn't help, find an active staff member. They'll point you in the right direction.

Did you enjoy Pokémon Day? We enjoyed their many announcements, and going into March we have a few of our own we would like to share. First off, we are introducing a new Bulbapedia:Staff hierarchy with updated staff role descriptions. This new staff structure eliminates some confusing redundancy in our ranks, and will provide both users and staff some clarity when it comes to duties and who can best assist with issues. Expect to see the various Bulbapedia administration pages updated this week. Since some ranks are being removed with this update, we want to extend a big congratulations to everyone who will be participating in a new role! And for those of you retiring from the Bulbapedia Staff team, we sincerely thank you for all of the contributions you have volunteered over the years. We wish you luck in whatever the future brings you! Second, in order to represent the current-day franchise accurately to our website's audience, we are solidifying two policy guidelines that will inform how to represent specific topics on the encyclopedia going forward. These guidelines are whenever possible, adopting current official terminology over dated terminology and adopting English terms over Japanese terms. Some affected examples are as follows: starter Pokémon, Effort values, Base stats, Pokémon the Series, Pokémon anime, settei, Scarlet & Violet Era (TCG), etc. Due to the deep integration some of these terms have throughout the encyclopedia, the specific solutions may vary, so staff will take the lead for the more complicated topics one by one. Tiddlywinks will be starting us off with the starter Pokémon move to first partner Pokémon! If you would like to help out with the change, please join in on the discussion on that article's talk page once the page is moved. We hope to see you there! In the same vein as adopting current terminology, with the recent introduction of the Stellar-type, we have audited our type colors to update them to current generation standards. This change provided a welcome refresh to our pages and repaired some inconsistencies we had with certain types, such as Fire and Fighting. We are soliciting feedback on any colors that need adjustment, so please flag any concerns on the Help:Color templates talk page, or the dedicated thread in our community discord. Leadership Board member Frozen Fennec is leading the charge, so get in touch if you have any concerns. Lastly, we will be upgrading our Pokémon card infobox in preparation for Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket. While we are busy drafting these new templates, we encourage anyone interested to post any suggestions they have on the Project TCG talk page. You can expect to see a test draft in the near future. That's all for now, zee you later!
