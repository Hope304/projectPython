Artspace will accept a bid at the next increment, and save any excess amount as a maximum bid. If you are outbid, we will continue bid on your behalf up to your maximum bid. Bid IncrementsBidding increments increase at the following intervals:Below $400: $50Between $400 and $699: $100Between $700 and $1,499: $200Between $1,500 and $2,499: $300Between $2,500 and $4,999: $500Between $5,000 and $9,999: $1,000Between $10,000 and $19,999: $2,000Between $20,000 and $29,999: $3,000Between $30,000 and $49,999: $4,000Between $50,000 and $99,999: $5,000Above $100,000: $10,000You will receive an email confirmation of your bid and when you are outbid. If you are the winning bidder, you will be contacted 48 hours after of the close of the auction.Maximum Bidding Every bid submitted is treated as a maximum bid. You should always bid the maximum you are willing to spend for a work, though this does not necessarily mean you will pay that price. As the auction unfolds, we will increase your bid by increments to ensure you remain the highest bidder. If the winning amount is less than your maximum bid, you will pay the current increment. If your maximum bid no longer exceeds the current bid, you will receive an outbid notification email, and have the option to bid again. In the case of multiple bidders placing the same maximum bid, the first person to place the maximum amount takes precedence as the highest bid until another bidder exceeds the maximum amount. Buyer's Premium & Additional ChargesFor Artspace Auctions winning bidders are charged a 15% Buyer's Premium on top of the hammer price. For Artspace Benefit Auctions, Buyer's Premiums are not applied. If they are, this will be clearly noted.
