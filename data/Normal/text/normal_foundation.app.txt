Inspired by an Asian ancient belief, “Invisible Redthread connects all who are destined to meet.” Redthread is about human connections. I wanted to visualize the invisible beautiful connections that we all build in life. In this specific piece, Redthread connects nature landscape as a symbol of our origin, like an umbilical cord to our mother nature. In reality, it can be invisible. It still exists in other strange world. The hint of red colors appeal in each different nature settings. Overall tones of Red touch warmth in a frozen world where is covered with complete white in a contrast. It looks like blossoming flower in the middle of Winter landscapes. It also transforms to nature as if it is a part of cycle. *You can view the AI film version at SR x ONBD* https://superrare.com/juneredthreadSee detailsBuy Now1.20ETHBuyFeatured exhibitions𝐜𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞p1xelfoolMar 13Presented by chromawareSaveUnder NeithNight Sea and 1 otherThu, 5:00 PMPresented by Forever ProjectsSaveStellabelle au CarréStellabelleMar 13Presented by Stellabelle au CarréSaveMomento MoriVentaOpenPresented by Venta's WorldSaveFeatured worksAvailableLois VoirolCaballero0.50 ETHAvailableKaeli VanFossenTo be 1 Eth or not to be? 1.00 ETHAvailableJack DalyNeighbour0.10 ETHAvailablerensiardintaNew Hope0.27 ETHAvailableJoaquín RodríguezThe Beacon0.30 ETHAvailableNikolina PetolasThe Missing Piece1.00 ETHAvailableBrelliasBreathe0.10 ETHAvailableEkin ÖyküW H I S P E R0.10 ETHFeatured worldsView allFoundationLearnWorldsDropsEditionsCompanyCareersHelp CenterSubscribeConnectXInstagramBlog© 2024 Foundation LabsPrivacy PolicyTerms of Service
