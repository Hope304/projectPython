Hundreds of delegates are at stake, the biggest haul for either party on any single day.While much of the focus is on the presidential race, there are also important down-ballot contests. California voters will choose candidates who will compete to fill the Senate seat long held by Dianne Feinstein. The governor’s race will take shape in North Carolina, a state that both parties are fiercely contesting ahead of November. And in Los Angeles, a progressive prosecutor is attempting to fend off an intense reelection challenge in a race that could serve as a barometer of the politics of crime.But the premier races center on Biden and Trump. And in a dramatic departure from past Super Tuesdays, both the Democratic and Republican contests are effectively sealed this year.

A previously predicted Winnipeg Transit deficit was replaced with a $1.3-million operating surplus.“It is good news. It shows prudent financial controls throughout the organization,” said Coun. Jeff Browaty, chairman of finance.Since the city often saw its finances improve during the final months of each calendar year prior to the pandemic, the rosier fiscal outlook may reflect a return to more normal conditions, said Browaty (North Kildonan). Read Yesterday at 6:19 PM CST Winnipeg's 2023 financial status is due in part to the significantly fewer snowstorms the city faced than in the pervious year.
