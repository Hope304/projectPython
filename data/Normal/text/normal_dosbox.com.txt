A security release for DOSBox 0.74: Fixed that a very long line inside a bat file would overflow the parsing buffer. (CVE-2019-7165 by Alexandre Bartel)Added a basic permission system so that a program running inside DOSBox can't access the contents of /proc (e.g. /proc/self/mem) when / or /proc were (to be) mounted. (CVE-2019-12594 by Alexandre Bartel)Several other fixes for out of bounds access and buffer overflows.Some fixes to the OpenGL rendering. The game compatibility should be identical to 0.74 and 0.74-2. It's recommended to use config -securemode when dealing with untrusted files. Ideally, 0.75 should have been released by now, but some bugs took a lot longer than expected. Thursday, December 13th, 2018 - Qbix GOG.COM have started their WinterSale 2018!
