Stay healthy this cold & flu season Keep yourself, your family, and your coworkers safe and healthy this cold & flu season by following these tips: Anything you touch may be full of harmful germs, so wash your hands often. Be sure to have an ample supply of hand soap available. Hand sanitizers are great for on-the-go hand sanitizing and should be available to customers and employees alike. Use disinfecting spray to kill germs on hard surfaces like doorknobs and counters. Disinfecting wipes are a convenient choice to quickly wipe down keyboards, computer mice, handles & more. If you aren’t feeling well, reduce the chances of others getting sick. Wear a face mask when in confined or crowded spaces when others are present. Keep tissues on hand and use them to stop the spread of germs when sneezing or coughing. If you do get sick, be sure to stay home, drink plenty of fluids and get lots of rest. Control your symptoms with over-the-counter cold & flu medicine.
