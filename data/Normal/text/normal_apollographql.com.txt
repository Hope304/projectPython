Define data once, deliver anywhere.Eliminate accumulated technical debt from backends-for-frontends or experience APIs. A GraphQL platform provides a secure source of truth for the data that powers your business.Reduce boilerplate code.Backend teams contribute to a unified and composable platform instead of building one-off backends-for-frontends or experience APIs.Create consistent user experiences.By introducing composability, your teams only have to define core entities and business logic once. Then ship anywhere, across any interface.Deliver features faster.GraphQL enables teams to deliver feature improvements and experiments faster by decoupling the backend and the frontend. GraphOS provides teams with the tools they need to deliver these benefits at any scale.Streamline collaboration across backend teams.Provide a central registry and standardized workflows for backend teams to work better together.Provide self-service for frontend teams.Apollo’s architecture enables frontend teams to fetch all of the data they need from a single endpoint, no matter where it is stored.Improve performance across applicationsGraphQL reduces latency by enabling frontend teams to fetch all of the data they need from a single request. Optimize GraphQL's performance gains even more with Apollo’s tools.Reduce latency across applications.GraphQL reduces unnecessary network calls that slow your apps down. Take advantage of these benefits at a broader scale using GraphOS Router.Diagnose issues quickly.GraphOS provides GraphQL-native metrics to improve performance. Export these numbers into DataDog or OpenTelemetry for further analysis.Enterprise teams trust ApolloDeep VarmaCTO at Varo“Really, it’s speed and agility that’s going to take you to the next level, rather than the technology itself. That’s why I get so excited about the supergraph.”Stephan LonntorpSenior Engineering Manager at Volvo Cars“Without the supergraph, we’d still be trying to figure out how to build a user journey for the fleet business.”Marcelo NalonStaff Engineer at Globoplay“Apollo GraphOS is a key platform for the development team to work softly with GraphQL. It provides a bunch of tools and APIs that allow us to establish a secure development pipeline to compose and deliver new pieces to our supergraph.”Mark FagaSenior Staff Software Engineer, Wayfair“Had contracts not existed, Wayfair would’ve invested 100s of person hours building out custom infrastructure to replicate what we get “built-in,” freeing up time to focus on Wayfair customer needs and developer experience.”Rick FastSVP of Engineering, Expedia“Using Apollo’s unified graph, Expedia rebuilt our entire trips experience 3x faster than our old approach. Adding new trip features to all our apps now takes days rather than months.”Sarah R.Senior Software Engineer at Nerdwallet“Teams that are moving to the data graph are bringing products and services to market sooner and dealing with bugs faster and less invasively.”Robbie SawersDirector of Engineering, Zillow Offers“We introduced a new subgraph in the federated graph [for backend compliance logic when Zillow was becoming a brokerage], and it was a complete success … 70 systems migrated without any advance, and we had the deadline, right on the dot.”Sankha PathakDirector of Engineering at Glassdoor“We have developed a very close working relationship with Apollo, which is critical to ensuring that we can help our customers through both good times and difficult times.”Nelson MiddendorffSoftware Engineering Manager, Hy-Vee“We have our vaccine finder [where] you punch in your location and select your store. Beforehand, you would select a location, and you wouldn’t know if a COVID-19 vaccine was available at a given store. You’d have to start over. Because we’re using GraphQL, we were able to drive new fields … with REST, way too much data [would’ve been surfaced] to the client.”Matt SextonSolutions Architect at Booking.com“In some cases, teams are almost doubling the speed at which they are releasing features and we are not even close to finishing our modernization journey ... We're just getting faster and faster.”Deep VarmaCTO at Varo“Really, it’s speed and agility that’s going to take you to the next level, rather than the technology itself.
