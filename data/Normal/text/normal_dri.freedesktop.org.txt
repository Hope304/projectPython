DRI Wiki DRI Wiki Edit Page History Repo Info Mesa 3D and Direct Rendering Infrastructure wiki Mesa is an open-source OpenGL implementation, continually updated to support the latest OpenGL specification. The current documentation for Mesa, including DRI drivers, is located at docs.mesa3d.org, this wiki contains old documentation that hasn't yet been migrated there. The Direct Rendering Infrastructure, also known as the DRI, is a framework for allowing direct access to graphics hardware under the X Window System in a safe and efficient manner. It includes changes to the X server, to several client libraries, and to the kernel (DRM, Direct Rendering Manager). The most important use for the DRI is to create fast OpenGL implementations providing hardware acceleration for Mesa. Several 3D accelerated drivers have been written to the DRI specification, including drivers for chipsets produced by 3DFX, AMD (formerly ATI), Intel and Matrox.
