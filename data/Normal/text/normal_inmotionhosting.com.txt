Website hosting service provides you with space on a web server to store your website’s data, such as web files, professional email, and databases. In simple terms, you are renting server space from a web hosting company to build your website or application on. The hosting provider owns and maintains the server, which is where your website’s files are stored. Depending on your chosen web hosting package, we also offer a range of features such as free SSL certificates, 99.99% uptime guarantee, a WebPro control panel for agencies and freelancers, and eCommerce hosting for online stores. Additional security is of the utmost importance when choosing a web hosting provider. That’s why we offer data backup solutions, dedicated IP addresses, and the option for PCI Compliance. Whether you’re a small business owner or a large corporation, we have a web hosting solution that can meet your needs and exceed your expectations. What are the different types of web hosting products InMotion Hosting offers? At InMotion Hosting, we take pride in offering a range of web hosting plans, including WordPress hosting, VPS hosting (virtual private servers), Dedicated Servers, Cloud Hosting, and Shared Web Hosting. As industry leading web hosts, we own and operate our servers, which means that we have complete control over their maintenance and operation. However, all of the data that you store on our servers belongs to you. We also offer web hosting platforms purpose-built to support and serve your favorite web applications, frameworks, and content management systems. These web hosting solutions are optimized for the fastest possible performance for your website and tailored to meet the specific server configurations needed of your web apps for an easy and worry-free web hosting experience, such as: Drupal Hosting, Joomla Hosting, OpenCart Hosting, Magento Hosting, PrestaShop Hosting, PHP Hosting, and more. What is Shared Hosting? Shared hosting is a type of web hosting service where multiple website domains are hosted on the same web hosting server, with each website allocated a specific portion of the server resources for their data and website. In other words, the server resources are shared among multiple websites, hence the name shared hosting. This type of hosting is generally the most affordable option for those looking to host a website. With shared hosting, you don’t need to worry about managing the server or its resources, as the hosting provider takes care of that for you. InMotion Hosting is a shared hosting provider with plans that can scale all the way through dedicated hosting. We offer a range of shared hosting plans to fit your needs, from basic plans for personal websites to more advanced plans for businesses with higher traffic and resource needs. Our shared hosting plans come with a range of features, including unlimited disk space and bandwidth, free domain registration, and easy-to-use website builders, making it easy for anyone hosting a website to get up and running quickly and stress-free. How do I switch web hosting providers? At InMotion, we make it easy to switch website hosts. Web hosting migration and website migration from a different hosting provider is offered at no charge based on the web hosting plan you have selected. Once you buy web hosting there are several methods to transfer to websites. We offer a free plugin if you would like to transfer your own WordPress website. If you need assistance, our support team is happy to help with cPanel to cPanel transfers. For a more complicated transfer, our Launch Assist website migration service program can transfer all of your files and databases to your new InMotion Hosting account. Some plans include Launch Assist or you can purchase it through our managed hosting department. Your data, website, and databases will have a seamless transition with zero downtime. If you are a web guru, you can also migrate your website to your new hosting plan without any assistance. How does the web hosting money-back guarantee work if I have prepaid for a year or more? We provide a full money-back guarantee on all web hosting plans, ranging between 7 days, 30 days and 90 days – depending on your hosting plan and renewal term. In the event, you prepaid yearly your refund will be prorated based on usage. We want to give you the best hosting experience, no matter if you’re coming to or leaving InMotion Hosting. Unfortunately, there are no refunds for addons or Remote KVMs. You can read all about our guarantee in our terms of service. Why should I choose InMotion Hosting as my web hosting provider?
