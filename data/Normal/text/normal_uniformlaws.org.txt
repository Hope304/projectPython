Our work simplifies life for people who live, work, or travel in multiple states and improves local economies by facilitating interstate commerce. Each uniform act is drafted in an open and deliberative process that draws on the expertise of state-appointed commissioners, legal advisors and observers. Learn More About Us Stronger States The ULC promotes state autonomy by providing a process for state governments to collaborate on issues where uniformity of law is necessary but federal oversight is not. Uniform acts provide rules and procedures that are consistent from state to state but that also reflect the diverse experience of the states when appropriate.
