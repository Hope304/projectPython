The definition of a VPN is a Virtual Private Network. Meaning, it’s a service that provides a secure and encrypted internet connection. It became a popular cybersecurity tool in recent years due to the rise of online threats on public networks. PIA VPN protects your digital identity by rerouting your internet traffic through private and secure servers. We have a vast global network of advanced VPN servers, and we use the best VPN protocols available to encrypt your personal data. PIA's Robust Server Infrastructure PIA VPN uses the IP Security Architecture (IPSec) open framework to encrypt and authenticate information. It encrypts outgoing data and authenticates incoming data. In both cases, the data is transferred through an intermediate secure server that handles all communication. That’s why the quality of these servers is crucial. PIA has a network of NextGen servers, designed and optimized with the best hardware components. Our colocated servers guarantee that our infrastructure is unreachable to third parties. We also upgraded our servers to have 10Gbps network cards and allow maximum connection speeds. These features ensure you get the safest and fastest connection possible. Get PIA VPN How Does a VPN Work? A VPN reroutes your internet traffic, encrypts your data, and masks your IP. This boosts your security and increases your anonymity .When you browse online, your internet traffic can be intercepted. Your data is accessible to your ISP, network admins, packet analyzers, and more. Rerouting your traffic through a remote server creates an effect similar to that of a tunnel — whatever goes through the tunnel can’t be seen by third parties. Using a private network gives you an advantage by employing high-grade encryption. Enciphering your data secures your private information. Can I be tracked when a VPN is on? Your online activities can’t be tracked when you’re using a top-shelf VPN. PIA’s VPN servers reroute and encrypt your internet traffic and mask your IP address in real-time. By using PIA you can make sure ISPs, government bodies, and cybercriminals can’t monitor your online activities and pinpoint your location. Concealing your IP address also prevents websites and trackers from identifying your online activities. This way, you’ll stay incognito, and bypass network blocks while traveling. A VPN is crucial to improving your online anonymity and freedom. Get PIA VPN 6 Benefits of Using a VPN Change Your Virtual Location Choose your online location by connecting to PIA’s extensive VPN server network.

They’re optimized with a Kill Switch to protect you from any accidental data leaks. Get PIA VPN for all your mobile devices in 3 simple steps: Step 1 Sign up for Private Internet Access Step 2 Download the PIA VPN app Step 3 Tap on the power button to connect Get PIA Mobile VPN What Is an Open-Source VPN? An open-source VPN releases the source code publicly for anyone to inspect. Through transparent practice, you can achieve stable and secure software. That’s why open-source VPNs are much more trustworthy. PIA is known as one of the best open-source VPNs. Anyone can analyze our VPN apps and VPN protocols, and verify the steps we take to ensure a safe and seamless connection. We also use WireGuard® and OpenVPN, two of the best open-source VPN protocols. Open-source coding also helps improve performance and innovate due to its cooperative nature. Having an open-source code lets PIA’s community members send suggestions. How to Choose the Best VPN for Yourself Speed Good speeds are vital. Choose a VPN that has top-of-the-line fast servers that seamlessly support streaming and gaming. PIA has ultra-fast 10 Gbps VPN servers, to allow you to enjoy buffer-free streaming and lag-free online gaming on any device. With our extensive global VPN network, you avoid overcrowding and congestion. Security When it comes to online security, quality encryption is crucial. That’s why you should pick a VPN that uses the strongest encryption protocols. It’s the only way to make sure ISPs, network admins, and government bodies can’t access your data. PIA VPN offers the most powerful encryption ciphers available — you can choose between 128-bit AES or military-grade cipher, 256-bit AES. Privacy You want a VPN that will protect your privacy. PIA has a strict No Logs policy. It was reviewed in an independent audit conducted by one of the Big Four firms. Our log-less service was proven twice in court. You can feel safe knowing we respect and support your right to privacy, and we don’t keep or store your data. Split Tunneling This important VPN feature allows you to create custom VPN connection protocols. For example, if you don’t want your banking service to flag your activity as fraudulent, you shouldn’t keep switching IP addresses. Set a case-based rule for its specific apps and websites easily. PIA VPN has an advanced split-tunneling feature that lets you create automated settings and choose which apps and domains can sidestep your VPN tunnel. Open-Source When it comes to VPNs, open-source is crucial for transparency. An open-source code allows you to take a look under the hood, and see how a VPN really operates. PIA VPN is the best open-source VPN. You can inspect our client source code, and see for yourself the steps we take to secure your traffic and data. Advanced & Convenient Protection If you feel that you need an extra layer of protection, look for a VPN that has a multi-hop feature. This feature, also known as double VPN, allows you to chain your connection through two VPN servers, boost your anonymity, and bypass censorship. With PIA’s multi-hop feature, you can reroute your internet traffic through a 2 RAM-only VPN that we designed to prevent data retention and protect your digital footprint.

Yes, VPNs are completely legal in most countries around the world. In fact, most governments understand the need for better online data safety and support VPNs as a consumer security tool. Some countries don’t feel the same, and allow citizens to use only state-approved VPNs which can have surveillance capabilities. While more policymakers and individuals are beginning to understand the importance of online privacy, the internet isn’t a safe and free environment yet. You need a quality VPN to protect your digital identity, keep your data private, and enjoy a free and safe internet. Can I Use a Free VPN? You can use a free VPN, but it’s not advised. Most free VPNs have a few common problems related to quality and security. Most free VPNs have fewer server locations because of budget restraints. This means their servers are usually crowded and slow, and they might not have a server in your country. The second issue is that most free VPNs have older servers. Using outdated hardware can lead to vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, and cause connection issues. Most free VPNs turn a profit by selling users’ data, showing in-app advertisements, or both. This is a major concern since the main goal of using a VPN is to protect your privacy.. Avoid these issues by trying an affordable and reliable VPN such as PIA. We have ultra-fast NextGen servers in 91 countries, we use the best VPN protocols for encryption, and we abide by a strict No Logs policy. Try PIA VPN Worry-Free Want To Know More? What are the primary uses of a VPN? A VPN is a cybersecurity tool that allows you to protect your digital identity and data. It also comes with many other benefits like fast VPN speeds for seamless browsing, sidestepping connection slowdowns, accessing your favorite content safely while traveling, and preventing cyber attacks like DDoS and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Are you completely anonymous with a VPN? You are not completely anonymous with a VPN, but you can boost your online anonymity with a top-shelf VPN. With PIA, you can encrypt your online traffic and mask your IP address to regain your digital privacy. By hiding your unique IP address, you can make sure your ISP and other third parties won’t be able to track your activities back to you. What is a No Logs policy? A No Logs policy means your VPN doesn’t collect or store your data. You might think this is a given for a privacy-focused service, but unfortunately, it’s not. Some services monetize by keeping users’ logs and selling their data. If you want to enjoy a truly private internet experience, you need a VPN that has a strict No Logs policy, like PIA. Do VPNs slow down a person's internet connection? A top-tier VPN won’t slow down your internet connection. It can even improve your speeds when your ISP is throttling your connection during streaming or online gaming. For example, PIA has ultra-fast servers, and uses the most efficient VPN protocols. This means that you can enjoy the online world at full speed, with no more stuttering or freezing. Should I run a VPN 24/7? You can run your VPN 24/7 as long as you have a VPN that has no bandwidth caps. Most VPNs have bandwidth restrictions, but PIA doesn’t. Use PIA to mask your online activities, and circumvent your ISP content-based bandwidth throttling. Stream, game, or browse the web privately as much as you'd like. Does a VPN work on any device? You can set up your VPN on any device if you have suitable VPN apps. PIA has native VPN apps for all major operating systems — macOS, Windows, Linux, Apple iOS, and Android.
