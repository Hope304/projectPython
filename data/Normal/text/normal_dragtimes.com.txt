To make a long story short, he wound up rebuilding the car that had been put together in a haphazard fashion. This is how it went down. Fresh off a tour in Afghanistan, Jason takes cross country delivery of the Nova and gets ready to load up the kids and take a test ride. Much to his chagrin, the front end is popping and cracking like a jalopy. After a total Read More READ MORE Audi RS3 (E60) vs. Ford Mustang GT (E85) – Street Hits play These two cars are as different as daylight and dark.
