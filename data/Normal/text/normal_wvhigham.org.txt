Morwen Higham entered into the glory of her Saviour on Lord's day 2 January 2022. Emphasis of Ministry His ministry has been characterised throughout by faithful Biblical preaching - emphasising salvation by grace alone which results in gracious, holy living - and a burden for the Lord to visit the church in reviving power. Vernon Higham's ministry is both practical and deeply experiential. Dr Martyn Lloyd-Jones once advised Vernon Higham to always bring the need of revival before the people. Vernon Higham most certainly put this into practice. The emphasis on the work of the Spirit and the need of a Divine Visitation is a hallmark of his ministry.

Godre’r Coed)O Lord, Thy touch hath stirred my soulAnd caused my heart to love;My quickened mind hath been made wholeTo seek those things above.There is a path of thought so trueThat brings me to Thy throne,And there my heart may mercy sueAnd claim Thy grace my own.Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heardThose things that thou hast there:For every promise of Thy WordAwaits my soul to dare.O why should I let sorrow reign,When such a God is mine,Who gives to me and gives again,And tells me, ‘Mine is thine’?The riches He hath stored for meNo measurement can tell;For in the love of CalvaryAll with my God is well.Thy Holy Spirit now hath taughtMy being to adore;The blessings Jesus Christ hath wroughtShall cause my soul to soar. © WVHigham Trust » WVHigham Trust Office: 029 20471124 » email: WVHigham Office »
