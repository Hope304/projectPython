In 2019, Eric worked for Senator Amy Klobuchar through the TechCongress program, with a focus on election security, vulnerability disclosure, and management of the .gov internet domain. Before that, Eric served in the 18F team at the U.S. General Services Administration, where he led the federal government's adoption of strong encryption for its online services. While at GSA, Eric oversaw Login.gov, which lets millions of people sign into U.S. public services securely and privately. Prior to 18F, Eric was a part of the Sunlight Foundation, a civil society group dedicated to government transparency. At Sunlight, Eric created open data services that helped the public follow government activity, advised Congress on its open data strategy, and provided expert guidance to anti-corruption NGOs around the world. Some of my work: Led the effort to require strong encryption (HTTPS) across U.S. government web services, by authoring federal policy and partnering with web browsers to secure .gov domains. Created a public bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure policy for GSA's Technology Transformation Services and 18F — the first in a civilian US government agency. Helped accelerate the internet-wide removal of the insecure SHA-1 algorithm for certificate signing, through approachable writing and useful technical tools. Created isitchristmas.com, an inexplicably popular service for determining Christmas where millions of people interact with each other and manipulate Christmas lights.
