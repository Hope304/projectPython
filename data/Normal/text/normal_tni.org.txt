At the same time, we expanded and strengthened the global movement for energy democracy and a just transition, with a particular focus on North Africa. We deepened our collaboration with food producers, particularly fisher people’s movements, to resist false solutions to the climate and environmental crisis. We forged new alliances and authored cutting-edge analyses to challenge the growing menace of digital capitalism. In response to the growing global arms race and the juggernaut of militarism, we offered a unique and vitally important counter-narrative. We also drew the connections between securitisation and a number of salient issues, from drug policy to climate change, and urged more just and equitable approaches. Our proposals and narratives reached audiences around the world.
