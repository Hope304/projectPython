Doing so, your app benefits from all the innovations made by Apple and Google to provide the unique user experience only a native app can provide, with things like memberships, one click checkout with Apple Pay, push notifications, offline usage, fast and smooth app browsing, a beautifully integrated design, …. This is a bold choice and our customers see a true difference compared to other app builders.Our apps are written with:iOS AppsiOS apps are written in Swift, the Apple technology offering unique capabilities to build stunning user experiences, tightly integrated with the iOS ecosystem.Android appsAndroid apps are written in Kotlin, a modern and open source programming language to build first-class Android apps, with contributions from Google. Progressive Web AppsWe love the web too! With GoodBarber, you can also create a Progressive Web App (PWA), the modern way to make a website that behaves like an app. We chose Angular for this.Advanced offlineNative apps allow for high quality offline functioning. Since it is possible to store all the contents in the binary file, a native app can very well do without a network connection to function properly. In reality, and for the majority of apps, not all content is in the binary. The use of the network is therefore necessary. Nonetheless, native apps make it easy to cache content on the phone. A dedicated algorithm optimizes the caching of the application's elements to ensure optimal, fast operation, whatever the connectivity conditions. This allows developers to craft optimization strategies to ensure useful operation of the app offline, without overloading the app's binary weight.At GoodBarber, No-Code = No-ComplexityThere are a lot of app builders in the market today, and honestly, their no-code approach sadly implies huge complexity.
