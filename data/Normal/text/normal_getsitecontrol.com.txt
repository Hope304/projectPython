Getsitecontrol is a tool that’s very intuitive and easy to use — setting popups is really straightforward. William Burgess CMO of MonsieurChaletsWe’re a company managing luxury cottage rentals. We started using Getsitecontrol to collect email addresses, and we had a really good conversion rate. In a day, we collected 256 emails! On another campaign, we collected 10,286 emails with a click-through rate of 4.6%. It’s a great tool, we love it here.
