AI Image Lab Pro is not available as part of the Annual or Lifetime membership, however, we offer a free version of the plugin. This decision is due to the fact that the AI image generation functionality is hosted on our servers, and it consumes a significant amount of server resources. As the number of images generated increases, our processing power costs also rise. To offset these expenses and provide access to the AI Image Lab capabilities, we offer a free version with limited features, allowing users to experience the technology without additional cost. Moreover, for Annual and Lifetime Members, we offer a significant savings in the monthly cost of AI Image Lab Pro.

We both love the subtle animations and how it adds to the professionalism of the site. The design overall clearly had a lot of thought put into it, it’s my go-to testimonial plugin from now on. Leslie Bernal A Girl And Her Mac I had very high expectations for Hosting and happy to say they actually exceded them. The personal support I have recieved from their server administrator has been amazing and the load times for my latest migrated sites MUCH faster than my current “Professional” hosting plan. They are the real deal. Scott Tambling Desert Digital I have been a WP Zone user for 5 yrs with some support from time to time. That last experience was needed because all my attempts at solving the presenting problem meant more time investment. Support was quick, responsive, and clear. There are many WordPress suppliers and likely excellent products. I simply source from WP Zone because of the back end support. For me, always on point. Paul Felt Trustpilot Review Everything WP Zone does looks so good, it makes me want to punch someone Josh Pollock Founder of Caldera Forms In this fast-paced industry it’s great to find a support team who is so quick to respond and eager to help. I can honestly say this is the first time in ages someone has VOLUNTEERED to help with a CSS challenge after a purchase and panicked email. For this reason I’ll look at the other plugins WP Zone offers and see if there are other good fits for our small business. THANK YOU. Small Details Trustpilot Review What can I say, before making my purchase I saw their reviews here on Trustpilot. After many years of experience with WordPress I have never had access to this level of service. Their top ratings and reviews are without doubt well earned and fiercely backed up with exceptional expertise and an outgoing support team to match. They always have time to get me up to speed, hand code custom solutions on the fly, basically never leave me in limbo. I Upgraded to the Lifetime Membership after trying out with the year one. The Lifetime Membership has access to one of the most amazing courses included with it. Oclair Trustpilot Review WP Zone have such great products! As a web designer who used Divi for all my builds, I am always on the lookout for good quality plugins to help me pull off my designs. Page builder everywhere and Testify have both helped take a number of my designs to the next level. Sarah Oates Endure Web Studios For me, Image Upload for bbPress Pro wasn’t just a plugin. Because there was Image Upload for bbPress Pro, I planned to make a homepage with WordPress. After the WordPress update, I had two times got a problems with plugin. But each time WP Zone people listened to my problem and solved it quickly. Jamnet kr Trustpilot Review Like most web designers, I have a list of plugins I use on every site and some are built by WP Zone. Page Builder Everywhere and Divi Switch are always part of my development process. I highly recommend WP Zone to any developer. They offer solid products which are backed by high-quality support.
