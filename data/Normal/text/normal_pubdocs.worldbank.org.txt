Public Documents Search The World Bank Public Documents The World Bank’s Access to Information Policy allows Bank-authored records to be made publicly available upon capture into the Bank’s records management system when given a “public” security classification. The Additional Documents search includes records that are classified as “public” and are still in the custody and use of the organizational unit that created them. Records may originate from any unit in the World Bank including operational, global practice, administrative, and research and policy. The Additional Documents search includes records published since June 2015. However, these records may have been created before June 2015 but were only recently published. To provide access to more information than ever before, the Additional Documents search includes records that do not appear in World Bank repositories which contain final and curated collections, such as Documents & Reports, Open Knowledge Repository (OKR), and Open Data. This search covers a variety of record types, including the following: correspondence; memoranda; draft and final versions of reports; training, conference, and event materials (presentations, meeting agendas and minutes); country information; non-project and non-program related legal documents; and records related to Bank projects (mission documents, aide memoires, and others).
