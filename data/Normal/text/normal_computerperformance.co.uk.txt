Independent advice on training. Exam QuestionsAbout This Site – Computer PerformanceI divided the site into three main sections, Windows Server, Windows Exchange and Scripting. My mission is to provide busy network managers with practical examples of how to configure their servers.If I have a specialty then it’s getting people started. So often if I can just point new-comers to the right menu, then what to put in the boxes is relatively self evident. What I also seek is to add real-world computer experience. Therefore, I never miss a chance to include tips and tricks learnt from the hard school of knocks.These days we need more skills than ever. Take scripting as an example, what started as a relatively simple task of creating a logon script has expanded into, VBScript, WMI, LDAP, ADSI and of course PowerShell. To be even a minor expert you need at least basic knowledge of 4 different scripting syntaxes.Each section contains tutorials on how to optimize settings and how to troubleshoot server problems. Topics within each section range from, logon scripts to migration, and from installation to disaster recovery.Whilst I have a string of MCT and MVP qualifications, my tips are based on experience gained from years of troubleshooting Windows servers. Moreover, I do not always toe the ‘Microsoft party line’ because I value my independent viewpoints.8 Best Network Monitoring Tools & Software Stephen Cooper April 16, 2019 Network Tools No Comments Network monitoring tools have become essential to ensure that the developed world’s increasingly IT-dependent businesses can function efficiently.
