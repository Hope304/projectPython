Bill Penzo Director of Patient Services & Contracting Body Scan International "CDXZipStream allowed me to process huge quantities of data very quickly. When I needed a different approach for calculating response times for a proposed fire station, CDX Tech responded within a week and added a new feature that easily did the job." Brent Coursin Co-founder Incipi Technology "CDX Technologies was able to create a custom template for our project, enabling us to complete the work in a fraction of the time. We now own this template and can utilize it for other projects, which will really help to streamline the process in the future." Jamie Travis Account Coordinator Coyne Public Relations "We need to identify our closest stores to each of the locations our clients supply. We used to do this manually with MapPoint. This could take many hours of repetitive, error prone work. Now with CDXZipStream, we just press a button and get our answer in minutes.
