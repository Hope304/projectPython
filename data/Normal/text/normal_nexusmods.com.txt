We spotted it a while back, lumbering over the horizon. It has since picked up such momentum that its arrival is now upon us. The site will hit 10 billion file downloads today. This is an epic milestone for Nexus Mods and the modding community. To put this number into perspective: If every download were a footstep, you could walk to the moon 11 times (1), or walk The Seven Thousand Steps (2) to High Hroth... 162 Comments Site News An update on App development 07 Feb 2024 Pickysaurus For the last 6 months, the new App Team have been working hard on laying the foundations for our next-generation mod manager - the Nexus Mods App. There isn't anything fancy to show just yet, but we'd like to share an update with you all on the technical choices and design decisions we've made so far.

We want to address some of the pain points users will have experienced and what improvements we have made as a result of your feedback. The new system was sending notifications for new comments on tracked mods. This was an error and we switched this off but 300,000 notifications of this type were delivered. We cannot easily delete these and you will see these if you are logging in f... 196 Comments Feature C3: Community Creations Con starts 2 Feb 29 Jan 2024 Pickysaurus Exciting News for our amazing community!

At least 4 of those uniques are in the Nexus Mods offices, where after-hours ‘research’ is being conducted. Whether you think this game has arrived out of the blue, or was an obvious hit, one thing is clear; It bears a lot of similarity to an existing game franchise you may have encountered, namely Pokémon. We won’t go into detail about potential similarities; suf... 142 Comments Interviews Enhancing Night City - deceptious 24 Jan 2024 JustThatKing We have the privilege of speaking with deceptious, a Cyberpunk mod author who pushes the boundaries of the types of mods that can be made.

The update was initially released yesterday but we have since rolled it back as it introduced a breaking change to content containing certain use cases of spoiler tags. Our biggest concern is that this problem occurs in the description of many popular mods so we've delayed the release ... 86 Comments Site News Community Forum Update 07 Dec 2023 Demorphic Summary Recently we let you all know about an update we planned to make to our forum software. Our previous forum software, unfortunately, was extremely out-of-date and was really holding us back on being able to make quick and tangible updates to the Nexus Mods website. We've now finished this update and this article is going to explain what's changed, why we made the change and what you can expect in the short- to mid-term because of this change. The New Forum <... 111 Comments Site News Forum Downtime 10 Nov 2023 Demorphic Update - 21st November. Forums are once again live. Please post any forum-related feedback here.

It's fair to say this is a feature a lot of users really wanted for browsing the website and it has been the most upvoted suggestion on the feedback board since we opened it earlier in the year. This new feature will show adult mods and media in search results and on the listing pages (e.g. the game homepage with the Hot Files) but the ... 277 Comments Site News Starfield Vortex Support Updated 21 Sep 2023 Pickysaurus Hotfix Update 2023-09-22 20:48 GMT A hotfix update has been released to temporarily disable some of the new features in this extension.

Things went a bit ‘stealth mode’ after that, so now it’s time to give more of an update on how the team has developed and how we see the next generation of mod management. This is going to be a long one, so buckle up! A brief history of Vortex Development of Vortex first began all the way back in 2016.
