That’s because, critics will say, those in power want to absolutely control the conversation, what can and can’t be said online, and thus directly influence the vote; whereas those in power say, it’s all just a perfectly benevolent effort to make sure misinformation plays no part in the campaign.

POLLAK The Biden Administration continues to apply new sanctions to Israeli individuals and firms as it faces pressure from left-wing activists to take a tougher stance against Israel, lest he lose support in key swing states in the 2024 election.

However, indicators that a US financial crisis might occur during this session of Congress, described by this first part of a three-part essay, warrant prompt attention, especially by the...

Regardless of what his supporters think about those charges, the wheels of justice are turning and Donald Trump will likely be convicted on several felony charges. When those convictions come will be critical to the question of whether Trump will take the oath of office from prison and whether he will govern from behind bars. Since it is a generally accepted legal opinion that a president cannot be prosecuted while in office (although there would likely be challenges to that tradition), if Trump is sworn in without being...
