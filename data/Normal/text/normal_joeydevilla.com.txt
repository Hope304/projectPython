Post author By Joey deVilla Post date February 29, 2024 No Comments on Happy Leap Day! It’s the last day of February — and a bonus day at that — so it’s the last day this image can be considered “current.” It’s been an interesting year, where I’ve enjoyed some sights, seen family I don’t often see, and earlier this month, I got laid off. That’s a lot, considering we’re only one-sixth of the way through the Gregorian calendar, and one-twelfth of the way through the Year of the Dragon! The next few months promise to be even more interesting, and I’m looking forward to taking them on. Categories Accordion, Instrument of the Gods It Happened to Me Feel free to interpret this photo Post author By Joey deVilla Post date February 28, 2024 No Comments on Feel free to interpret this photo Tap to view at full size. I was helping out at the “Speed Networking Lounge” at the Synapse Summit conference earlier today, where they divided the room into areas where people could go to discuss different topics, which were marked by balloons. I was in the “Artificial Intelligence” area, and after the speed networking session ended, they let me take the balloon, which I tied to my accordion. The balloon’s been attached to the accordion all day, and the accordion’s been with me wherever I’ve gone all day, including the Rollin’ Mullet pub in my neighborhood. That’s when I noticed I had an opportunity to take an “art” photo — hence the image above. Feel free to assign whatever meaning or symbolism works for you to the photo.
