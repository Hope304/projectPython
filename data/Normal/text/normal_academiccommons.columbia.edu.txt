Open access has been incredibly effective in helping my writing reach new and important audiences.” Sharon Marcus Orlando Harriman Professor of English, Columbia University “Academic Commons has enabled us to distribute citable versions of all our work, including software products. It tracks how much the software is being accessed, which helps us show the impact of our work.” Simon J.
