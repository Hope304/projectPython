Recommended by Calissa Anderson Sardinia & Corsica “I love the ocean and this trip has a lot of it. Plus… I’ve heard the food is off the charts on this trip!” View Trip Recommended by Jess Summerling Norway's Lofoten Islands “Jagged peaks & ridgelines, looking down to stunning white sand beaches, surrounded by the calm & outdoor-loving Norwegian culture, and fueled with the best cinnamon buns of your life! Vast and beautiful nature to take your breath away.” View Trip Recommended by Sam Jenkins Portugal’s Azores “I grew up reading about the Azores in sailing books. It’s a paradise for active adventure with winding mountain roads and the sea all around. Totally off the beaten path.” View Trip Recommended by Emma Silver California’s Yosemite “Impossibly tall cliffs, giant sequoias and magical waterfalls. Yosemite is legendary and I can’t wait to get there!” View Trip Recommended by Cal Kevorkian Japan “Japan seems like a place unlike any other and I know Backroads will bring me up close and personal with it. I’m eager to explore the geology of the islands, but immersing myself into the deep, rich culture really gets my blood pumping.” View Trip Recommended by Sasha Tcherepanov Kentucky “The culture of the state sets it apart. The hospitality of the locals, the rich traditions of bourbon distilling and horse racing. You really get a local’s perspective on this trip. And the riding is divine.” View Trip Recommended by Anna Lynch Dolomites “Gorgeous views, great café huts on the hikes with delicious strudel and coffee, and cows with bells around their neck. You feel like you’re in The Sound of Music!” View Trip Available Trips Departing Soon Check out these upcoming adventure tours with availability or explore more destinations here.
