Read MoreTodayâ€™s Cryptocurrency Prices, Charts and Data Welcome to CoinMarketCap.com! This site was founded in May 2013 by Brandon Chez to provide up-to-date cryptocurrency prices, charts and data about the emerging cryptocurrency markets. Since then, the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency has grown exponentially and we are very proud to have grown with it. We take our data very seriously and we do not change our data to fit any narrative: we stand for accurately, timely and unbiased information. All Your Crypto Market Data Needs in One Place Here at CoinMarketCap, we work very hard to ensure that all the relevant and up-to-date information about cryptocurrencies, coins and tokens can be located in one easily discoverable place. From the very first day, the goal was for the site to be the number one location online for crypto market data, and we work hard to empower our users with our unbiased and accurate information. We Provide Live and Historic Crypto Charts for Free Each of our coin data pages has a graph that shows both the current and historic price information for the coin or token. Normally, the graph starts at the launch of the asset, but it is possible to select specific to and from dates to customize the chart to your own needs. These charts and their information are free to visitors of our website. The most experienced and professional traders often choose to use the best crypto API on the market. Our API enables millions of calls to track current prices and to also investigate historic prices and is used by some of the largest crypto exchanges and financial institutions in the world. CoinMarketCap also provides data about the most successful traders for you to monitor. We also provide data about the latest trending cryptos and trending DEX pairs. How Do We Calculate Our Cryptocurrency Prices? We receive updated cryptocurrency prices directly from many exchanges based on their pairs. We then convert the number to USD. A full explanation can be found here. Related Links Are you ready to learn more? Visit our glossary and crypto learning center. Are you interested in the scope of crypto assets? Investigate our list of cryptocurrency categories. How Do We Calculate Our Crypto Valuations? We calculate our valuations based on the total circulating supply of an asset multiplied by the currency reference price. The topic is explained in more detail here. How Do We Calculate the Cryptocurrency Market Cap? We calculate the total cryptocurrency market capitalization as the sum of all cryptocurrencies listed on the site. Does CoinMarketCap.com List All Cryptocurrencies? Almost. We have a process that we use to verify assets. Once verified, we create a coin description page like this. The world of crypto now contains many coins and tokens that we feel unable to verify. In those situations, our Dexscan product lists them automatically by taking on-chain data for newly created smart contracts. We do not cover every chain, but at the time of writing we track the top 70 crypto chains, which means that we list more than 97% of all tokens. How Big Is the Global Coin Market? At the time of writing, we estimate that there are more than 2 million pairs being traded, made up of coins, tokens and projects in the global coin market. As mentioned above, we have a due diligence process that we apply to new coins before they are listed. This process controls how many of the cryptocurrencies from the global market are represented on our site. What Is an Altcoin? The very first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin. Since it is open source, it is possible for other people to use the majority of the code, make a few changes and then launch their own separate currency. Many people have done exactly this. Some of these coins are very similar to Bitcoin, with just one or two amended features (such as Litecoin), while others are very different, with varying models of security, issuance and governance. However, they all share the same moniker â€” every coin issued after Bitcoin is considered to be an altcoin. What Is a Smart Contract? The first chain to launch smart contracts was Ethereum. A smart contract enables multiple scripts to engage with each other using clearly defined rules, to execute on tasks which can become a coded form of a contract. They have revolutionized the digital asset space because they have enabled decentralized exchanges, decentralized finance, ICOs, IDOs and much more. A huge proportion of the value created and stored in cryptocurrency is enabled by smart contracts. What Is a Stablecoin? Price volatility has long been one of the features of the cryptocurrency market. When asset prices move quickly in either direction and the market itself is relatively thin, it can sometimes be difficult to conduct transactions as might be needed. To overcome this problem, a new type of cryptocurrency tied in value to existing currencies â€” ranging from the U.S. dollar, other fiats or even other cryptocurrencies â€” arose. These new cryptocurrency are known as stablecoins, and they can be used for a multitude of purposes due to their stability. What Is an NFT? NFTs are multi-use images that are stored on a blockchain. They can be used as art, a way to share QR codes, ticketing and many more things. The first breakout use was for art, with projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club gaining large followings. We also list all of the top NFT collections available. We collect latest sale and transaction data, plus upcoming NFT collection launches onchain. NFTs are a new and innovative part of the crypto ecosystem that have the potential to change and update many business models for the Web 3 world. What Are In-game Tokens? Play-to-earn (P2E) games, also known as GameFi, has emerged as an extremely popular category in the crypto space. It combines non-fungible tokens (NFT), in-game crypto tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi) elements and sometimes even metaverse applications. Players have an opportunity to generate revenue by giving their time (and sometimes capital) and playing these games. One of the biggest winners is Axie Infinity â€” a PokÃ©mon-inspired game where players collect Axies (NFTs of digital pets), breed and battle them against other players to earn Smooth Love Potion (SLP) â€” the in-game reward token. This game was extremely popular in developing countries like The Philippines, due to the level of income they could earn. Players in the Philippines can check the price of SLP to PHP today directly on CoinMarketCap. What Are ETFs? In January 2024 the SEC approved 11 exchange traded funds to invest in Bitcoin. There were already a number of Bitcoin ETFs available in other countries, but this change allowed them to be available to retail investors in the United States. This opens the way for a much wider range of investors to be able to add some exposure to cryptocurrency in their portfolios. Which Is the Best Cryptocurrency to Invest in? CoinMarketCap does not offer financial or investment advice about which cryptocurrency, token or asset does or does not make a good investment, nor do we offer advice about the timing of purchases or sales. We are strictly a data company. Please remember that the prices, yields and values of financial assets change. This means that any capital you may invest is at risk. We recommend seeking the advice of a professional investment advisor for guidance related to your personal circumstances.
