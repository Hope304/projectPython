Sessions are normally late-morning until mid-afternoon because I work for Total Traffic Network (formerly Metro Traffic) in Detroit. I can be heard early weekday mornings doing voice over traffic reports on WJBK-TV's Fox 2 News Morning and weekday afternoons on other stations. All voice overs are digitally recorded and available by Internet download as soon as it's done or on CD. It's a great service for independent producers working with tight budgets needing a professional male voice. Experienced Production Pro No time to direct voice talent? Studios booked up? That's OK. Benefit from my many years of experience in Detroit as a Radio Production Director and Air Talent. I'll get directions from you before I record digitally and in the rare instance you need a retake, no problem. I can take direction as well by basic phone patch, but if you don't have time for that, I can get it done on my own as I do for most producers. I'm not just a voice talent. I'm also available for late morning and early afternoon sessions at studios in the Detroit area and can travel to nearby cities in Southeast Michigan and Northwest Ohio for voice over sessions (Farmington, Southfield, West Bloomfield, Troy, Birmingham, Sterling Heights, Warren, Pontiac, Ann Arbor, Jackson, Lansing, Flint, Toledo and other cities within short driving distance). Thanks to the Internet, my services have been used around the USA and places all over the world! More Voice Over Benefits A fresh new voice for your ad campaign/narrations... I don't sound like everybody else doing voice overs. High quality digitally recorded sound...MP3 Files are mono 160kbps which is equivalent to stereo 320kbps. WAV files are 16-bit/44.1khz or 48khz by request for video producers who need it. You save money by not having to cover the cost of ISDN connections and equipment.Good turnaround. I won't take work if I can't get it done. Usually 1 day on spots - same day with advance notice is usually possible but not guaranteed due to my other commitments. Small narration projects (couple pages) are usually done in 1- 2 days, but larger narration projects do take more time to complete - they can be split up and done in sections if desired.An equally strong effort on every project, large and small.
