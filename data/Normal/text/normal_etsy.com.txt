Read our wonderfully weird story A community doing good Etsy is a global online marketplace, where people come together to make, sell, buy, and collect unique items. We’re also a community pushing for positive change for small businesses, people, and the planet. Here are some of the ways we’re making a positive impact, together. Your purchases on Etsy in 2020 generated nearly $4 billion in income for small businesses. We advocate for policy—at the global and local level—that benefits creative entrepreneurs and helps small businesses grow and thrive. We are deepening our commitment to a sustainable future and are working towards a new goal to reach net zero emissions by 2030. Support independent creators There’s no Etsy warehouse – just millions of people selling the things they love. We make the whole process easy, helping you connect directly with makers to find something extraordinary. Peace of mind Your privacy is the highest priority of our dedicated team. And if you ever need assistance, we are always ready to step in for support. Have a question? Well, we’ve got some answers.
