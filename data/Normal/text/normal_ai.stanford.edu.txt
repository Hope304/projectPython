The greatest long run impact will come by really assimilating prior bio/compbio literature with the goal of really understanding strategies for how to model biology. 1/ Reply on Twitter 1763997389189521688 Retweet on Twitter 1763997389189521688 112 Like on Twitter 1763997389189521688 708 Twitter 1763997389189521688 Retweet on Twitter Stanford AI Lab Retweeted ; Aaron Lou @aaron_lou ¬∑ February 29 1763242384958386306 Announcing Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion (SEDD) w/ @chenlin_meng @StefanoErmon.

It‚Äôs especially prominent in agent and robotics applications and we can get significant benefits from figuring this out. This work is a step in that direction.
