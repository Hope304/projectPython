(No’ 10) No one would have dreamed that they were being scrutinised by someone who treats us like we’re a disease that swarm and multiply in the inner cities. Yet somewhere in the gulfs of hell, minds immeasurably more evil than ours regarded our lives with such disdain and slowly and surely drew their plans against us!

Feeling horrible is a sin, Having survived hell is something to be proud of? Let me tell you something As a small child I was abducted I survived the road to hell; hell itself, and back again This left my body broken And my mind shattered Let me ask you something Are you more empathetic when I smile and shrug And say: hey! This is me and I love my wheelchair Or when I tell you I struggle every day? The answer is not that simple Yes, I am a survivor But it’s not an accomplishment It is just a status report: I survived Am I a victor? Yes I am. I won, you see? I still live, and put some of them in prison.

Leonard Bernstein says about music, to the effect, ”An old friend becomes more dear” Refining one’s awareness There can be no drudgery, But there must be effort, Must be the look-through, A soul’s effort to find. Therein lies the beauty, The finding.

First a single chirp from a lone bird, next a response from a mate in reply. Then as if on cue from a conductor, other birds join in the antiphony. And the entire feathered orchestra breaks forth in a chorus of praise to God. Next, it is time for the sun to serenade, with sounds of praise quite different from the birds. In its bowels, acoustic waves vibrate and cause its surface to jiggle. Though silent, the sun plays its melody in super deep bass notes like a tuba. It also provides the lighting effects for the symphonic sounds that surround us. The forests of human caricatures, dressed in their flowing robes of varied green, need the wind to make them play their music. As the wind vibrates their stems and leaves it produces music so soothing and sweet. At times, the notes are like those of violins, or mellow like those of the cello. A change of wind can make them sound like bass. Sometimes the conductor pulls out the stops, and nature explodes with loud sounds that pop. The wind howls, branches snap and the trees sway, and then the rain joins in the refrain, turning leaves into tambourines and shakers. A loud thunderclap and lightning flash, create a wild symphony that most surely rocks. As creatures of the Creator’s hand, we too must add our songs sublime, through living for his glory now, we join with birds, sun, wind, and trees, and stars and mighty oceans wild, to daily raise our voices loud, In thanks to God, for life and Son, as part of nature’s symphony of praise.

Myriads of flittering birds sang in the trees. At peace on our cabin porch with feet on the rail Until a trumpet blast called me to hit the trail. When at last would come my soldier’s release To return to our laurels, birds, and peace? With the martial trumpet silent once more, All survivors returned to their home shore. Would I limp stiff legged down the last mile, To laurels, and birds, and your peaceful smile? Alas, but a dream that came not to pass. My future lay beneath the clover grass. Wrapped in red, white, and blue came my release, To scentless laurels, silent birds and wailing peace.

He was given this earth that he might subdue, He could have the Lord to help him through But, Lo he has chosen his own way to pursue If history follows, without the Lord there, repeated mistakes when we leave his care. Then wars ensue didn't we just pass this way, I believe it is a repeat of yesterday?

Heart and soul mix, stirring the imagination; as the mind sets free the unknown, secret possibilities locked inside! A shadow dancer sets in motion without thought to time or place. Sensuality emits all around as the shadow dancer begins this unbridled dance allowing thoughts and feelings to guide the way. A shadow dancer has imagination and rhythm, while the heart, mind and soul add spirit and surety; creating a dance filled with freedom and set to the wind! This dance can’t be captured or bridled for its known only to the dancer and is created from a secret place within. A shadow dancer expresses quietly, shinning in this ritual, freeing the heart, mind, and soul, allowing movement to begin freeing the body to dance its desires, creating magic all around the dancer. A shadow dancer finds music where its silent and moves as if set in motion by angels. Just as a music box dancer begins, a shadow dancer sets forth in motion; releasing dust from within! A shadow dancer is heart and soul, guided by love and spirit, freeing occasionally this dance of dreams; combining the heart, mind, and soul.

Huh! All lives matter. Is she is being deliberately obtuse? Should I add ‘’too’’ or ‘’do?’’ She adds, I’ve blacks in my family. We had indigenous girls in nursing school. Never treated them any differently. U.S. blacks are lucky not to be back in Africa. I feign agreement. How right you are. African Americans must be grateful, living in that land of the free. I’m sure George Floyd felt overjoyed to have such good fortune. A cop’s knee on his carotid. Hands in pockets. The killer whistling, while his victim choked to death… ii Whites rarely experience racial slurs. Get shot in the back. Suffer unlawful arrest. People of colour endure such abuses every day. US parents drill kids, on strategies to survive. Be invisible. Don’t answer back, even if the cop is wrong. Never argue with a white. Keep car radio down. Blacks are stopped for loud music. Or shot reaching for their license. ‘’Illegal’’ U.S. kids, from babies to teens, are locked in cages. So much for a country founded on immigration. iii Colonial settlers in both countries stole indigenous land. Gifted themselves black house slaves. Cattle-yard slaves. Money never seen. And what sort of men shot innocent blacks after church? Set fire to their circular homes. Poisoned wells. Rigid in the belief of white superiority, they denied tribal links to country. Ignored their knowledge of survival. But sorry began our crucial journey of healing . iiii Don’t close your eyes to acts of violence. Hundreds of Australians and Americans have died in police custody. And - oh yes - they were black. Let’s step forward in unison, kin under the skin. Protect police whistle blowers. Hear them speak the truth. Get rid of crooked cops. Educate and create an honorable force. And, yes: Black lives do matter.
