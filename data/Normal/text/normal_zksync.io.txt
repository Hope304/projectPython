Our mission is not only to merely increase Ethereum's throughput, but to fully preserve its foundational values – freedom, self-sovereignty, decentralization – at scale.Read the ZK CredoWe stand forTrustlessnessSecurityResilienceForkabilityCommunity OwnershipRead the ZK CredoHyperscalability: the EndgameTo meet web3's exponential demand, blockchains needs to scale like the Internet: processing an unlimited number of transactions without a marginal impact on security or cost. We call this property hyperscalability, and this is the ultimate goal of ZK Stack.Build on ZK StackLearn about hyperchainsSecurity++ZK-rollups like Era are the only scaling solution that can inherit 100% of Ethereum's security. But theory is not enough. zkSync is committed to go above and beyond to make Era by far the most secure L2, in practice.Explore Security230M+txs (from inception)1M+Contracts deployed$6M+Spent on audits & bountiesA brand new Era for UXSelf-custody combined with intuitive, delightful, and security-fostering UX is critical to onboard the first billion users to web3. Era's design started with the end-user in mind.Magical UX on EraStart using zkSync Era by bridging to the networkUse a native bridge or ecosystem partners to transfer tokens from Ethereum and other networks to zkSync. Or exchange fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies using Fiat Onramps.Bridge nowExplore zkSyncPushing the frontier, together.Over 200 projects from Chainlink, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aave, Argent, Gnosis, Curve, and many of the world's largest brands have registered their interest to deploy on zkSync.
