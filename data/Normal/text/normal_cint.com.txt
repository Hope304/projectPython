Having a strict delineation between the two allows us to drive our business increasingly towards fully automated fulfillment. Cint were great to work with during the integration phase of the project. They were there for the long run, working with us on hardening the API integration as we uncovered and fixed edge cases. The outcome is a high level of automation, a reliable API integration, and peace of mind for Zappi.Callum Liddle, Product Manager, Zappi1234See what we can do for youLeadership teamsCompete based on technology and outsmart your rivals.
