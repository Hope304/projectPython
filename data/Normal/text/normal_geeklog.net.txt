The code is re-developed, but the database stays the same for now. See latest developments or demo yourselves with a large grossary. The plugin is intended to create glossaries for your site, whilst your content can be enriched with links to known glossary entries. Multiple subjects are supported and a autotag lets you choose which subject to use for a certain text. Make sure you have users added to the glossary.admin and/or glossary.edit security groups. Glossary catches the userID that submits a term, and the userID that edits a term. Along with a timeStamp. Categories can be defined which work site wide. Configuration is still old-fashioned; find them in config.php. Available languages are English and German (with thanks to Alexander Schmacks). read more (154 words) Post a comment Comment (0) Page navigation First Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next Last Search Search advanced search Resources About What is Geeklog?
