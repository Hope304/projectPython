Our multidisciplinary teams pursue big ideas using innovative science and technology to meet our national security mission and make the world a better place. Our Mission-Driven Work For more than 70 years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has applied science and technology (S&T) to make the world a safer place. While keeping our crucial mission-driven commitments in mind, we apply cutting-edge science and technology to achieve breakthroughs in nuclear deterrence, counterterrorism and nonproliferation, defense and intelligence and energy and environmental security. Nuclear Deterrence We develop and apply the S&T needed to assure the safety, security and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile in an ever-changing threat environment and enable the modernization and transformation of the NNSA production enterprise. Climate and Energy Security Our team advances understanding of the global climate system, develops technologies to reduce accumulation of greenhouse gases and pursues the domestic production and supply of affordable clean energy delivered across a secure and sustainable infrastructure. Threat Preparedness and Response LLNL provides unique capabilities and innovative solutions to stem proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction, understand capabilities and anticipate adversarial actions and support response and consequence mitigation of natural and man-made biological threats. Multi-Domain Deterrence The Laboratory creates a global strategic advantage through innovative technologies, strategies and analysis to bolster escalation control and defensive capabilities across the full spectrum of domains including strategic defense, conventional strike, space and cyber and technology competition.
