New media artist and educator Agnes Chavez named 2024 guest artist New media artist Agnes Chavez will bring her creative approach to integrating art, science and technology to the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. She has been named 2024 guest artist by the Fermi Research Alliance. Scientists get ready to observe neutrinos with SBND The Short-Baseline Near Detector collaboration at Fermilab has started filling their detector with liquid argon. It's one of the last steps before the detector sees its first particle tracks. New measurement of cosmic distances in the Dark Energy Survey gives clues about the nature of dark energy The Dark Energy Survey (DES) has just measured the BAO scale when the universe was half its present age with an accuracy of 2%, the most accurate determination yet at such an early epoch, and the first time an imaging-only measurement is competitive with large spectroscopy campaigns specifically designed to detect this signal. Engineers Week at Fermilab offers inspiration Engineers at Fermilab work on a wide breadth and depth of technical work. This week, the laboratory celebrates their accomplishments and learns about new projects. India formally begins construction phase for contributions to Fermilab's new particle accelerator India's Department of Atomic Energy is making a $140 million in-kind contribution to the PIP-II accelerator under construction at Fermilab. Indian institutions will provide a number of technical components for the new machine. The collaboration provides Indian scientists the training, technical insight and know-how for the development of their domestic particle accelerator program.
