Opening: Sickboy – ‘Optical Delusions’ @ Harvey Nichols (Bristol) Posted by feralthings, November 24, 2023 Mixing art and fine dining, Sickboy (interviewed) is kicking off his latest show at the high-end department store Harvey Nichols tonight with a launch dinner and artist’s talk. Optical Delusions is presented by Fluorescent Smogg and builds upon his ever-expanding use of semiotics to create a dream-like world that glows and radiates light. The Bristol-based artist has long experimented with an array of unorthodox mediums: from painting on bell-jars in the early 2000s, to creating tapestries a decade later and onwards to the lightboxes which […] Continue reading... Tweet Showing: José Parlá – ‘Phosphene’ @ Ben Brown (London) Posted by feralthings, November 17, 2023 Closing today after a four week run, Phosphene is José Parlá’s second show at Ben Brown Fine Art’s London location. The title references the phenomenon of seeing light without any external stimulus and the exhibition features 11 large scale canvases infused with kinetic and sensory energy. For many, graffiti is a means to exist beyond the corporeal and social confinement of our current circumstances and the now Brooklyn-based artist’s Ease tag was like a visual mantra repeated across south Miami in search of personal perfection. […] Continue reading... Tweet Openings: Jeff Soto – “Sadlands” @ KP Projects Posted by sleepboy, September 27, 2023 Earlier this month, Jeff Soto’s (interviewed) new exhibition Sadlands opened up in West Hollywood at KP Projects. Showing though the end of the month, the striking new body of work featured almost 20 medium to large sized paintings inspired by a post-apocalyptic Southern Californian landscape. Each piece, rendered in vibrant colors, correlates loosely with a location that the Riverside native denoted on a map (displayed in the gallery) with the sides of the frames painted to color coordinate with each pinned location. This conceptual thread nicely […] Continue reading... Tweet Showing: Alistair Canvin – ‘Do Not Over Inflate’ @ Plan X Posted by feralthings, September 26, 2023 Earlier this week, Alistair Canvin presented his debut solo exhibition at Plan X Gallery in Milan. The show, entitled Do Not Over Inflate, presents a series of photorealistic paintings depicting deflated flamingoes, crocodiles and beach balls set against a backdrop of water-refracted pool tiles. The partial use of an airbrush captures the tactile, plasticky feel of those objects and evokes memories of holidays in the sun. At first glance, the work’s aesthetic appears to reference youthful simplicity and the carefree optimism of childhood. But, this […] Continue reading... Tweet Preview/Art Focus: Futura – ‘Breaking Out’ @ University of Buffalo Posted by feralthings, September 20, 2023 Retrospectives are rarely as overdue as the one opening on Saturday at the University of Buffalo Art Galleries. Breaking Out spans both of the university’s locations – UB Center for the Arts and the UB Anderson Gallery – and provides a comprehensive survey of the five decade-long career of Futura. So, it seems like a timely opportunity for us to take a look back at the life and works of one of the most innovative and influential artists of our time. Leonard Hilton McGurr was […] Continue reading... Tweet Showing: Banksy – ‘Cut and Run’ @ GOMA Posted by feralthings, August 19, 2023 After a sold-out 10 week run at Glasgow’s Gallery of Modern Art, Banksy’s first solo show in almost 14 years comes to a close next week. The exhibition, entitled Cut and Run, gives the public the opportunity to rediscover paintings which have appeared around the world over the last 25 years; many of these can no longer be found on the street and, in some cases, the streets themselves no longer even exist. The exhibition displays the original stencils used to create many of his […] Continue reading... Tweet Showing: Beyond The Streets (London) Posted by feralthings, February 22, 2023 The art establishment has a less than distinguished history when it comes to embracing artists who fall outside of its comfortably familiar linear narrative of western art. Impressionism was a derogatory name bestowed by the art critic Louis Leroy and the fabled Salon des Refusés exhibition of work by the movement’s most prominent figures was comprised of pieces rejected by the the Académie des Beaux-Arts’s annual exhibition in Paris. With stylewriting – or graffiti, as its early detractors called it – history has repeated itself […] Continue reading... Tweet Releases: Top 10 Books of 2022 Posted by feralthings, December 22, 2022 Despite the indisputable importance of digital media in the art world, the appetite for physical books remains undimmed and this year has seen the release of some beautifully crafted works. So, in no particular order, here are our favorite books published in 2022. ‘4000’ by INVADER The Parisian-artist’s global invasion is undoubtedly one of the largest and most ambitious art projects that has ever been undertaken. In addition to photos of all the 4000 pieces which he has created in 80 cities worldwide over the […] Continue reading... Tweet Release/Benefit: Banksy – ‘Fragile/Agile’ Posted by feralthings, December 15, 2022 Continuing his support for humanitarian causes around the globe, Banksy is releasing a new screen print in partnership with Giles Duley’s Legacy of War Foundation. The proceeds will help those directly impacted by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine by allowing the Foundation to purchase ambulances and generators as the country heads into the harsh winter months. The image features a white mouse whose claw marks, individually made by Banksy with a sharpened pizza cutter, have obscured the first two letters of the work ‘fragile’. The […] Continue reading... Tweet Remembering: Mike Dring Posted by feralthings, December 8, 2022 Mike Dring, the gallerist and curator behind Bristol’s Art-El Gallery, sadly passed away last week. During an era when money was increasingly coming to the fore, the Bristol-native was always focused squarely on the art and the artist. He worked with several of the key figures loosely associated with the city’s graffiti scene including Rowdy, Acerone and Mr Jago ensuring they had someone in their corner as street art gained increasing public prominence. The latter remembers Mike as “always being there for encouragement…and for drinking […] Continue reading...
