Cemetech members were certainly busy this month, and there are already a number of great projects for you to try. As always, remember to vote for your favorite project completed in January in the poll, and without further ado, here we go! AnotherWorldCE: Port of the classic 16-bit game to TI84+CE: Zaalane has improved savestates in his port of Another World, which no longer require any user RAM. This gives them a lot more stability and should rule out any issues with failing to save. Bad Apple on Crab Fit: commandblockguy has once again found another thing to play the Bad Apple animation on, this time on an event scheduling planner called Crab Fit. For those who don't remember, he previously managed to do this on a Google doc using the comment feature. There's a longer video of the impressive feat in the topic, so be sure to check it out yourself! CalcText BASIC, a script to simplify text programs: reptile23 has continued work on their project, which aims to make creating text programs in TI-BASIC easier. This month, they added a custom tag / trigger system, multiple statements per line using backticks, and a tag that will run its contents at the beginning of each new line. CARDoK!L: Randomized Card Wonder: ryanconmartians has begun working on a card game for the TI-84 Plus CE, where you must use your deck to fight against your opponent. CE Automated Testing Framework: Captain Calc made a utility which can make automated testing simpler for C++ projects using the CE C toolchain. You can create a test JSON, which the Python script will use to build and then run the test with cemu-autotester. CE HD Picture converter (for Web, in Rust): Tari has corrected a bug in his web version of TLM's picture converter, along with a few other minor changes. CEaShell: A Shell for the TI-84+ CE: RoccoLox Programs and TIny_Hacker continued work on the full rewrite of their shell, this month adding integration with HexaEdit, correcting an issue with going to errors when running TI-BASIC programs, and a fast alpha scrolling feature for the TI-OS editor, inspired by Doors CSE 8. Creating a Hybrid Basic OS for all of my games: tibasicprogrammernoobie1 has begun working on a program to conveniently view and play the games they create on their TI-84 Plus. They're still in the beginning stages of the project, so head over to the topic to show your support! Gimme 5!: A word-guessing game [TI-84 Plus CE]: Captain Calc has created a new version of their word-guessing game, featuring a brand new, well-stylized interface. A pre-release version is already available in the archives if you're interested in checking it out yourself! HD Picture Viewer [C] [TI-84 Plus CE]: TheLastMillennial has finished the second major version of his picture viewer. This new version is more stable, easier to use, and much improved compared to the last version. He also has a few ideas for future updates, including possible 16bpp or GIF support. HexaEdit CE: On-calc hex editor: Captain Calc was busy this month, and he also published a new version of HexaEdit which fixes a bug and has a slightly changed GUI. Be sure to check it out! Illusiat 13: The Final Chapter revival: Dream of Omnimaga has revisited an old project from 2009, making a number of improvements including save file archiving, DCS icon, balancing, and more! He's known for making impressive games in TI-BASIC, so it's definitely worth taking a look! lwIP Library with CDC-ECM for the TI-84+ CE: ACagliano is working on a version of the lwIP for the TI-84 Plus CE, along with a CDC-ECM driver to support computer and router connection. Particle System in C++ for the TI-84 Plus CE: RedSpacePanda has been working on a flexible, performant particle system for the TI-84 Plus CE, written in C++. There are a number of use-cases for such a tool, especially in games. Be sure to keep an eye on it for a public version you can use in the future! PiEditor - an alternative program editor: pi644721 has been creating an editor for TI-BASIC programs, written in TI-BASIC using the Celtic CE library. The editor currently has a number of features you can expect, along with the added bonus of being able to display more lines at once than the OS's editor, since it uses a smaller font. Sonic 2 CE: A port of 8-bit Sonic 2 for the TI-84+ CE (WIP): grubbycoder has continued fixing bugs in their Sonic 2 port, and has managed to get tilemap scrolling working! There's still more that needs to be done, but the project continues to feature impressive progress, so be sure to take a look yourself! Speedread... 2: ryanconmartians has teased a new sequel for his Speedreading game. There's not much to see yet, but keep an eye out for future updates! Spriter, a TI-BASIC sprite / icon editor for the TI-84+ CE: TIny_Hacker has published a new version of his TI-BASIC sprite editor, which includes bug fixes, an import feature, and a more visible cursor along with other accessibility features. tivars_hexfiend_templates Development Thread: LogicalJoe has finished the core functionality of his templates for the macOS hex editor, HexFiend. Some recent changes include greater file support, especially for 68K calculator files. Train Simulator Controller: KermMartian has been working on an immersive and realistic controller system for one of his favorite hobbies (besides calculators, of course), Train Simulator. This month he showcased a controller prototype he worked on last May. That's all for January! Now it's time for you to get to work on a project of your own, to be featured in next month's PotM article! Permalink Cemetech Projects of the Year 2023 Results Published by Michael2_3B 1Â month, 2Â weeks ago (2024-01-18T13:00:00+00:00) | Discuss this article Ending our amazing saga of back-to-back PotM/PotY articles, the results are in for the 2023 Projects of the Year! This poll was absolutely no contest... Cemetechians seemed to unanimously vote for the same best project! In 3rd Place, we have Topicle, created by kg583! Based on the popular word puzzle game Wordle, Topicle features four words which you must successfully guess, all relating to a central clue, or, as the name suggests, topic. Solving a puzzle is a fun workout for your brain, and when youâ€™re done, you can even share your score with others to brag about your word skills (as many Cemetechians have done in the project thread)! In 2nd Place, we have Ti-83+SE/84+(SE) Video + Audio Player, created by Crazy_Fox2! Unlike previous video or audio players for these calculators, this program is able to play video and audio simultaneously. According to the topic, the Silver Edition calculators can hold around 1 minute of video, while the non-Silver TI-84 Plus can hold around 20 seconds. The audio quality is equally impressive. And last but not least, in 1st Place, getting over 50% of the votes, and taking the official title for Project of the Year 2023, we have Celtic CE by RoccoLox Programs! They have successfully created the first hook-based TI-BASIC library for the TI-84 Plus CE, which allows TI-BASIC programmers to use a number of graphical and utility operations which are not possible or extremely slow with vanilla TI-BASIC. It also features detailed and concise documentation, making it easy to work with despite the scale of the library. For a good idea of what Celtic can make possible, be sure to check out some of the other projects featured in the PotY. Thank you to all of our members that participated in the poll, and be sure to keep the great projects coming! Feel free to read more about all of the projects from Projects of the Year 2023 in this article. Permalink Cemetech Projects of the Year 2022 Results Published by Michael2_3B 1Â month, 2Â weeks ago (2024-01-14T13:00:00+00:00) | Discuss this article At last, the poll for the Projects of the Year 2022 has come to a close, and the results are in! This poll saw quite some competition, and it appears many Cemetechians had a hard time choosing just which project they liked best... Nonetheless, we now have a winner, so let's get into it! In 3rd Place, we have none other than S.A.M.M. - A Metroid-vania for TI-84 Plus CE, created by Captain Calc! S.A.M.M is a Metroid-vania style game for the CE that features lots of beautiful artwork and compelling gameplay, and features things like environmental interaction and smooth scrolling. Be sure to check it out! In 2nd Place, we have AnotherWorldCE, created by Zaalane. This game is a fantastic port of the original old adventure game "Another World" by Ã‰ric Chahi. The program is more or less an interpreter for the VM designed for the game. You don't want to miss this one! And last but not least, in 1st Place, having only one more vote than 2nd Place, and taking the official title for Project of the Year 2022, we have CEaShell by RoccoLox Programs and TIny_Hacker! CEaShell is a simple, easy-to-use shell with some basic QoL improvement features for the 84+CE. It is designed to be straightforward and easy to use, but with some additional polish like program icons in the OS [PRGM] menu. Lots of hard work went into this project, and it has really paid off! Be sure to download the shell for yourself! Thank you to all of our members that participated in the poll, and be sure to keep the great projects coming! If you would like, feel free to read more about all of the projects from Projects of the Year 2022 in this article. Permalink Projects of the Year: 2023 Published by TIny_Hacker 1Â month, 3Â weeks ago (2024-01-10T14:00:00+00:00) | Discuss this article Welcome to Cemetechâ€™s 2023 Projects of the Year voting poll! Given the rapid pace at which the PotM team has been working, youâ€™ve probably already got a great idea of how this works. Right on time at the beginning of the new year, itâ€™s time to vote for what you believe to be the best project completed in 2023! The projects featured in this article are the winners selected from the Projects of the Month articles from 2023. We encourage you to not only read about the projects but try out as many as you can before voting as well. January (Project List): Ti-83+SE/84+(SE) Video + Audio Player: Crazy_Fox2 has created a video player for the monochrome TI-83 Plus SE and 84 Plus / 84 Plus SE calculators, which unlike previous video or audio players for said calculators is able to play video and audio simultaneously. According to the topic, the Silver Edition calculators can hold around 1 minute of video, while the non-Silver TI-84 Plus can hold around 20 seconds. The audio quality is equally impressive. February (Project List): PRIZM racing: a 3D multiplayer racing game for the fx-CG50: duartec has created a 3D racing game for the Casio fx-CG50, which not only features impressive graphics, but calc-calc multiplayer over a link cable as well. The game runs quite well for a 3D calculator game and is certainly worth giving a try, maybe with a friend! March (Project List): Topicle: A clue-based Wordle game: kg583 and his friends created an online puzzle game which took Cemetech by storm in early 2023! Based on the popular word puzzle game Wordle, Topicle features four words which you must successfully guess, all relating to a central clue, or, as the name suggests, topic. Solving a puzzle is a fun workout for your brain, and when youâ€™re done, you can even share your score with others to brag about your word skills (as many Cemetechians have done in the project thread)! April (Project List): Ludo - Game for the TI-84 Plus CE: ZebraVogel and eins_maxe worked together to create a slick version of the classic board game Ludo for the TI-84 Plus CE. You can play with 1 - 6 players in two different game modes, along with challenging the computer (or rather, calculator) as well! May (Project List): No projects were completed this month! If only you had completed a project in May 2023, you could have gotten into PotY, uncontested. June (Project List): SlimShell: AchakTheFurry has created another shell for the TI-84 Plus CE written in TI-BASIC, utilizing the Celtic CE libraries for graphics and file manipulation! SlimShell features a smooth and easy to use interface, where you can view, run, and modify your files. It also features some well-crafted animations to make the userâ€™s experience even more satisfying. Achak has a lot of experience creating shells in TI-BASIC, so itâ€™s certainly worth taking a look and trying it for yourself. July (Project List): Celtic CE: RoccoLox Programs has completed the first hook-based TI-BASIC library for the TI-84 Plus CE, which allows TI-BASIC programmers to use a number of graphical and utility operations which are not possible or extremely slow with vanilla TI-BASIC. It also features detailed and concise documentation, making it easy to work with despite the scale of the library. For a good idea of what Celtic can make possible, simply check out some of the other projects in the poll that use it, and if youâ€™re working on an elaborate BASIC program, be sure to look into giving it a try. August (Project List): Spriter: While on a road trip without much to do, TIny_Hacker made a spriting program written in TI-BASIC utilizing Celtic CE. The program features two different sprite formats, zooming in and out while in the sprite editor, and the ability to export as a program icon as well. Itâ€™s still a useful tool for creating sprites for TI-BASIC programs on-calc. September (Project List): Solar-powered TI-84 Plus: TheLastMillennial has hooked his TI-84 Plus up to a solar panel to successfully power it, with hopes of modding his CE to charge over solar in the future.While you canâ€™t try out TLMâ€™s calc for yourself, heâ€™s also made a video on his YouTube channel showing the project in more detail, so be sure to check that out as well! October (Project List): Express BASIC: lucidapogee created a minimal BASIC language for Windows 95 and up, with the intent of being more standard than some BASIC dialects and the ability to perform complex calculations. The minimal version features more universal commands while the extended version includes graphics and sound commands as well. It runs in the Windows console, which lets it work well on a variety of Windows versions. November (Project List): CalcClicker: Inspired by the classic clicker game genre, CoolModder has made a calculator-themed clicker game for the TI-84 Plus CE! It features a very nice design and a number of upgrades to improve your calculator production rate as well. If youâ€™ve ever wished for a larger calculator collection but canâ€™t afford to buy more physical calculators, now you can have a massive collection of calculators on your calculator! December (Project List): CrossBun: commandblockguy published his project just in time to snag a spot on Decemberâ€™s PotM, and it was so popular he quickly reached the PotY as well! CrossBun is a crossword game for the TI-84 Plus CE which allows you to import .puz files from websites like Crosshare to play on-calc! Itâ€™s a lot of fun and certainly impressive given the amount of time it was completed in, so if youâ€™re a fan of crosswords download some puzzles and give it a try! Congratulations to all the people who reached the PotY! Be sure to vote for your favorite project and be on the lookout for 2022â€™s PotY voting results soon!
