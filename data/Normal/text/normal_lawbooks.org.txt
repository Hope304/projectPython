USING LAW TEXTBOOKSA law textbook explains legal terms and legal doctrine within the context of the historic development of the law. Is there one book for all law students? The answer is no. In addition, when using law textbooks, it will be difficult for students to summarise all of the pages in a legal textbook into their own notes. If any of those phrases struck a chord with you, then you have come to the right place. ​ WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A LAW BOOK ​ Every student is unique with a different method of learning. But you have one thing in common - you are all studying law. When making a choice about which law book to buy, think about the following: ​ 1) Know your reading speed. 2) Do you want to improve background knowledge? 3) Where are you likely to find the information you need? 4) Does the book offer a preview? 5) Is the book laid out into sections? 7) How dense is the book and how effective? ​ The content of our law text books may guide you toward a better understanding of how to study the law.LAW BOOKSSEE OUR FEATURED LEGAL TITLESThe most recent editions of law books that are now on sale may be found in the collection that has been compiled by Private Law Tutor Publishing.
