The awards honor the movies released in 2023. Filmsite has one of the most extensive and comprehensive compilations of the history of The Oscars extending back to the late 1920s through to the present day. Included are facts, trivia, remarkable firsts, milestones, and much more - including winning Best Picture posters. It was remarkable that the range of great films this last year (2023) was as broad and varied as it turned out, including a number of historical or fact-based biopics (Maestro), epics (Oppenheimer and Killers of the Flower Moon), a unique and weird sci-fi black comedy (Poor Things), and a tabloid-story based melodrama (May December). Two major films: the fantasy Barbie (with 8 nominations) and historical Oppenheimer (with 13 nominations), known as the phenomenon of "Barbenheimer," will be competing head-to-head in five categories.

Detailed plot synopses, review commentary and film reference material are just some of the features available on the site. The site also contains film analysis, original content, information on the top films and most memorable movie scenes, "Best of..." articles, and the most popular film quotes in all genres of film. Its many resources include a comprehensive overview of film history, a complete survey of the Academy Awards (Oscars), milestones and turning points in the industry, and background and descriptions for hundreds of classic Hollywood/American and other English-language movies from the last one hundred years. In the mid-1990s when it was first launched, filmsite.org was one of the first websites to initiate the trend to select 100 Greatest Films in the history of cinema. About Film Historian Tim Dirks Tim Dirks created the popular filmsite.org website, aka Filmsite or Greatest Films, in mid-1996, and the site will celebrate its landmark 28th anniversary in 2024. He has been writing about and reviewing films on the site ever since. Tim originated Filmsite and has remained its sole contributor, manager, and editor - he adds significant content to the site spanning all the years of cinematic history, often writes blogs and other film-related articles, and has engaged in a number of on-camera interviews about film. Wikipedia has called the site "an introduction to cinematic literacy," and CultureSonar referred to the site as "A One-Man IMDb." The site has averaged over time about 10 million page views per year (see visitor and traffic statistics). Roger Ebert Endorsement Film critic and columnist Roger Ebert, author of The Great Movies (2002), The Great Movies II (2005), and The Great Movies III (2010) made many detailed references to filmsite.org in his Chicago Sun-Times "Answer Man" column and in his many writings about the Great Movies over the years. He has written that the site is "an invaluable repository of movie descriptions and dialogue" and that it is an "awesome website [that] contains detailed descriptions of 300 great American films, along with many other riches."
