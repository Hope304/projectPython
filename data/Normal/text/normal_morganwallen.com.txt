The album’s 6x-Platinum single “Last Night” reeled in over 1.5 billion streams globally, becoming the most-streamed song of any genre in the U.S. across Apple Music and Spotify, and the longest running No. 1 solo song in Hot 100 history (16 weeks total). With 11 chart-toppers at country radio, Wallen recently wrapped his five countries / three continents 57-show One Night At A Time World Tour stadium tour. Playing to over 1 million fans in 2022 and 2023, Wallen’s One Night At A Time World Tour was the only country tour named to Deadline’s “Top 10 Music Tours of 2023,” surpassing attendance records in numerous stops; including Ohio Stadium, where Wallen became the largest weekend ever for the venue, shattering records previously held by George Strait and Taylor Swift. Resuming this April in Indianapolis, Ind., the 2024 extension of One Night At A Time takes Wallen to 29 additional stadium-plays. Wallen donates $3 from every U.S. ticket sold to his Morgan Wallen Foundation. © 2024 Morgan Wallen. All rights reserved. Privacy Policy | Website by: Stephen Craven
