Subscribe to our YouTube channel and stay up to date! Our Partners Have questions about wallet? Contact us, we are always welcome to help you [email protected] How does Atomic Wallet work? Atomic Wallet is a non-custodial decentralized wallet. It means that you own your backup phrase and private keys, thus, you fully control your funds. We have no access to your wallet and your sensitive information. Your 12-words backup and private keys are stored locally on your device and strongly encrypted. Moreover, your funds are not located in the wallet itself, there are safely stored on the blockchain. Atomic Wallet connects directly to the blockchain nodes and shows the information about your balances, transaction history and everything you see in the wallet. It also allows you to perform transactions on the blockchain. Atomic Wallet also provides you with exchange and buying crypto services with the help of our partners. What is a 12-word backup? Your 12-word backup is the key to your wallet. It has essential meaning for keeping your funds safe. Think about it as a login to your bank account: whoever owns it, can access your funds. 12-word backup is a master key that is provided to you when you first create the wallet. Public and private addresses for each coin are derived with specific algorithms from your backup. If you keep your 12-word backup safe, your wallet is safe. We recommend to store it offline in two different places. Never share it with anybody, even the members of our team! Is Atomic Wallet safe? Atomic Wallet is an interface that gives you access to your funds on the blockchain. The most important information, such as your private keys and backup phrase, is stored locally on your device and is strongly encrypted. The wallet and all the operations within it are protected with a password. Atomic Wallet doesn't store any of your private data, making you the exclusive owner of your keys and funds. Answering the question, your wallet is safe if you follow these basic safety rules: Keep your device safe. If your device is compromised, the wallet can be compromised too. Never share your 12-word backup or private keys with anybody. Your backup is like a key to your wallet, whoever owns it, owns the funds. Take your passwords seriously. Make a unique and strong password for Atomic Wallet and store it in a trusted password manager. Even more cool features are coming Subscribe × Thank you for downloading Atomic!
