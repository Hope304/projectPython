That’s why to build truly prosperous rural areas, we must make value chains not just strong, but sustainable. Highlights Highlights IFAD13: A new day is possible IFAD13: A new day is possible. Now is the time to invest in a resilient future. IFAD’s response to the war in Ukraine Conflict and food insecurity go hand-in-hand. As a major food and commodities exporting region, the war in Ukraine has caused not only a humanitarian crisis, but is also increasing food and fuel prices, which in turn are impacting the world’s most vulnerable people. Climate and environment Smallholder farmers and poor rural people bear the brunt of climate change and the degradation of natural resources. Extreme weather events, such as droughts, storms and floods, are putting pressure on the ecosystems that farmers depend on. IFAD and the SDGs The 2030 Agenda is a commitment to “leave no one behind”. It applies to all countries and spans social, environmental and economic issues. This commitment is most salient in rural areas as shocks, such as climate change and the COVID crisis, disproportionately affect rural communities.
