I've built custom WordPress designs and used different membership plugins, and by far MemberPress has provided more services and better value for the price. A true "win-win" solution. David Abling Zion Eye Media Having tried most membership plugins for client sites over the years, MemberPress stands out as a great combination of rich features but easy to use. I'm a big fan of the members' self-serve dashboard, quick setup, reports, and the automated emails. And the fact that they offer excellent customer support is also a major plus. As a result, we use MemberPress for our own membership site and whilst I don't believe there is always a ‘one-size fits all' membership plugin, MemberPress is pretty darn close. Callie Willows Membership Geeks Over many years of building membership sites for clients, we've built many of them with MemberPress.
