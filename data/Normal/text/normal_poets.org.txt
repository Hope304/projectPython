When cancer made her immobile, knowing my then averseness to cooking, she hesitated even to ask for favors. I wanted to celebrate how Mummy rarely paid heed to mistakes. This poem helped me find a place where my grief-birthed guilt felt less guilty, if not unnecessary. The long unending line is another mortal attempt to not let my mother go.”—Preeti Vangani Load audio player Academy of American Poets · Preeti Vangani: "One Cup of Chai" If I had known that the cup of chai my mother asked me, a drifter in the kitchen, to make her that afternoon, which I having blended water and milk in such strange ratios that when reduced and strained the tea came up to barely one trisection of my pinkie (that cup was the driest well I saw, the lowest tide) so to cover my blunder I poured raw tap water to flood her cup and fled her room before she could collect her body, bring lip to saucer, had I known that the pale, putrid mess I presented, was after all, the only and last cup of tea I’d ever make her would I have suddenly been granted the culinary wisdom to brew instead the pot with sprigs of lemongrass, a pod of cardamom, perhaps even a prestigious thread of saffron that I’d sneak from the silver hexagonal box she kept hidden behind the airtight jars of pricey nuts, and bring her a creamy drink of complex caffeine, even make some magnanimous promise of offering her tea on tap till she lived but knowing me, I know I’d have just continued being the spectacular failure I was that day, shit-talking my every inability out of her sight, embarrassed by failure, afraid of consequence and knowing her, she would have creased her nose at first, then continued to descend on the plate with the hopeful pull of her slurp, stubborn as she was, not willing to peg one finite judgement of adulation or derision— on the cup she was served Copyright © 2024 by Preeti Vangani.

Corrothers 1922 Compensation O, rich young lord, thou ridest byWith looks of high disdain;It chafes me not thy title high,Thy blood of oldest strain.The lady riding at thy sideIs but in name thy promised bride. Ride on, young lord, ride on! James Edwin Campbell 1922 A Poem for My Wife I’m in my room writing speaking in myself & I hear you move down the hallway to water your plants I write truth on the page I strike the word over & over yet I worry you’ll pour too much water on the plants & the water will overflow onto the books ruining them If I can’t speak out of myself how can I tell you I don’t care about the plants? how can I tell you I don’t care if the books get wet? David Meltzer 2005 I Have Folded My Sorrows I have folded my sorrows into the mantle of summer night, Assigning each brief storm its allotted space in time, Quietly pursuing catastrophic histories buried in my eyes. And yes, the world is not some unplayed Cosmic Game, And the sun is still ninety-three million miles from me, And in the imaginary forest, the shingled hippo becomes the gray unicorn. No, my traffic is not with addled keepers of yesterday’s disasters, Seekers of manifest disembowelment on shafts of yesterday’s pains.
