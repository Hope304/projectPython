Those who recognized this obvious fact are not against RCTs. Jonathan Howard / March 3, 2024 Fiction Skeptics in Pub. Cholera. Chapter 11a The morning started too early. For some reason, I snapped awake just before sunrise and could not fall back to sleep. Probably that ball of guilt in the pit of my stomach. I suspected it is a minor example of what a condemned man feels on the morning of his execution. I lay in bed and stared thoughtlessly at the ceiling waiting...

Clay Jones / March 1, 2024 Science and Medicine Quality differences of supplements vs. drugs When it comes to drugs or dietary supplements, accuracy should be a given.

How? A combination of the Nirvana fallacy and spin. David Gorski / February 26, 2024 Fiction Skeptics in the Pub. Cholera. Chapter 10b A young woman was waiting at the pump. She introduced herself as Amy Blogg, an Illustrator for the River Weekly. She quickly let us know that she had been briefed by Mrs. Howitt. I demonstrated the workings of the microscope on a blade of grass and an ant. It was met with the usual expressions of amazement by first-timer users. If I... Mark Crislip / February 24, 2024 Science and Medicine The Great Barrington Declaration Wasn’t a Plan For Public Health Officials. It Was a List of Absurd Demands of Them. The authors of the GBD advised and influenced many politicians at the highest level. They claim to have delineated many practical policies to protect the vulnerable, and they said it would’ve been possible, certainly. So an obvious question emerges. Why didn’t they protect the vulnerable? Jonathan Howard / February 23, 2024 Politics and RegulationPublic Health Pesticide in Oat Products – Should You Worry?
