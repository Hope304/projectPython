Every uploaded image is analyzed to apply the best possible JPEG encoding. Based on the content of your image an optimal strategy is chosen. The result is a quality image without wasting storage or bandwidth!Why should I use TinyJPG?JPEG is the most popular format for photos on your websites and apps. Many JPEG files do not use optimal compression, wasting valuable bytes. Balancing quality and small file size used to be a time consuming task that only humans could do. Not anymore. Let us worry about compression.How does it work?Excellent question! When you upload a JPEG file, the image is analyzed. Textures, patterns and colours are automatically identified. The encoder creates an optimally compressed JPEG file based on that information. The final result is compared with the original and fine-tuned. Distracting JPEG artifacts are minimized without big sacrifices in file size. Unnecessary metadata is stripped as well. You will get an optimal image, every time!Can you tell the difference?Let me give you a side by side comparison. Move the slider to compare the compressed image with the original. The file size is reduced by more than 70%!OriginalFile size:641 KBTinyJPGFile size:162 KBTrusted by thousands of companies around the worldAskSamsungAmazonWalmartDrinksElectronic ArtsBank of AmericaPetaAirbnbNBC UniversalSonyPrinting.comFlokHertzGrabilitySamsungSavings.comBurtonTry TinyJPG with a new browserTinyJPG is created for modern browsers with HTML5 & CSS3 support.
