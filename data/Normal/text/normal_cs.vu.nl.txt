About VU Faculty of Science Computer Science The science behind the computers View our research Computer Science Our research program is concerned with understanding the foundations, the mechanisms, and the technologies for developing and deploying advanced information-processing systems. The last couple of decades have brought forth major changes to our society. Perhaps the most prominent one is the proliferation of computing devices. By 2021 it is safe to say that the number of computing devices exceeds the number of human beings in any given living or work space in the developed world. A closely related trend is that of connectivity. Devices and their owners are connected, forming a world wide web. The global network, also known as the Internet, is augmented by local ones in virtually all homes and offices. Our lives are not only interwoven with computers, but also inherently networked. It is this background that sets the scene for the Department of Computer Science.
