Seth Godin Bestselling Author I started using this tool and it turns out it's a simple web development tool that is all plug and play... It's hard for me to imagine a website being ten times more beautiful than what you can build with Strikingly. Rebecca Bloom Editor & Writing Coach I run a small business from home and I quit GoDaddy long ago because it was expensive and pretty byzantine. I work part-time and I don't want those hours spent on satellite website issues — I want to maximize my earnings. Strikingly is so intuitive and functional. I love it! I've told tons of my friends about it already. Mike Pacifico Lead Advisor I actually just want to say how impressed I've been with the site/software/mobile app. I looked at a few options before going with Strikingly, but I'm so glad I did. Amazing UI/UX, perfect balance between being simple, yet customizable – and at no point was I "stuck"; everything just seems to work. Great stuff and thanks again! Zia Kusuma PR Manager & Teacher I'm one of your big fans! Strikingly is just amazing! I always had problems choosing templates or themes whether it's on Tumblr or Wordpress, with a bunch of options, but only few (like really few) that suits my taste. But Strikingly won my heart! David Smooke Founder, ArtMap When we first starting looking at Strikingly, we were taken back by how beautiful things were. Strikingly makes it so easy to make their templates your own that by the time you're done, the page won't have a "theme," it'll be yours. Ease of use, check. Beautiful, check. Different, check.
