Welcome to Red Hat Bugzilla Thank you for visiting Red Hat Bugzilla. Red Hat Bugzilla is the Red Hat bug-tracking system and is used to submit and review defects that have been found in Red Hat distributions. Red Hat Bugzilla is not an avenue for technical assistance or support, but simply a bug tracking system. If you submit a defect, please provide detailed information in your submission after you have queried Red Hat Bugzilla to ensure the defect has not been reported yet. Defects will go directly to the engineer responsible for the component you filed the defect against. Engineers have many responsibilities and will get to your defect in due time. If you are a Red Hat customer with an active subscription, please visit the Red Hat Customer Portal for assistance with your issue. If you are a Fedora Project user and require assistance, please consider using one of the mailing lists we host for the Fedora Project.
