Schedule a Demo Why Marigold Engage by Sailthru? Have a question? Ask us anything Why do I need personalization? For one thing, your customers have come to expect personalization, whatever that means to them. Personalization isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach and as modern consumers are inundated with marketing messages, relevant, personalized communications are far more likely to catch their attention. Luckily, personalization is just as beneficial for you. The Boston Consulting Group predicted that companies fully invested in personalization will outsell their competitors by 30%. Every year, Marigold Engage by Sailthru audits, analyzes and quantifies the personalized marketing capabilities of 250 retailers, alongside a consumer sentiment survey. Year after year, we find that people prefer shopping with the brands — and engaging with the publishers —that offer the strongest personalized experiences. Everyone says they have best-in-class customer service. What makes you so special? Partnership is core to our business model. When onboarding to Marigold Engage by Sailthru, every customer is assigned a dedicated Customer Success Manager to help kickstart short-term and long-term success with the platform. These people are not extensions of the Sales team tasked with upselling you. Instead, they’re more extensions of your team, trained on industry business models and trends in order to provide customers with the best strategic guidance. We have an in-house Deliverability team to not only help Marigold Engage by Sailthru maintain one of the top sender reputations in the business, but also ensure your company hits the inbox. For your strategy, we conduct Strategic Business Reviews, benchmarking analysis, insights workshops and anything else you need. That’s just the short list. Why is Marigold Engage by Sailthru a better choice for my company vs. legacy marketing clouds? Marigold Engage by Sailthru enables advanced personalization within its core email platform, with out-of-the-box features designed to create real connections with your customers and subscribers. Legacy marketing clouds are not built with personalization as an integral part of their platform, and approximate personalization through acquisitions which need to be bolted on and often come with additional services fees. With many roadblocks requiring customer service requests and developmental resources for small changes and updates, legacy marketing clouds are often difficult to use as well. The Marigold Engage by Sailthru platform was designed for ease of use. You can personalize email campaigns with a single click or build automations yourself on day one, whether or not you know how to code. However, simplicity should not be mistaken for a lack of sophistication. Continuous innovation is at the heart of Marigold Engage by Sailthru, with new native tools and feature enhancements being released throughout the year, following deep dives into what our customers want in the core platform. In comparison, legacy marketing clouds often resort to flashy acquisition-based additions to their clouds, which tend to require additional services and license fees. Marigold Engage by Sailthru's obsession with customer success yields thoughtful and efficient implementations, high-touch strategic guidance and impactful program analysis to identify opportunities to push your business forward.
