Increasing Voters Through Mobilization NAACP was on the ground in key battleground states and deployed lawyers throughout the nation to monitor and respond to reports of voter suppression through their Voter Protection Hub, ensuring that every American was provided an opportunity to cast their ballot.Protecting Democracy in Alabama The NAACP Alabama State Conference were plaintiffs in the June Supreme Court case against Alabama where they rightfully argued that the state's congressional map was a clear attempt to minimize the voting power of the state's Black residents. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of drawing a new Alabama congressional map which will allow for greater representation of Black voters in the state.
