General talk on Mastodon at @KelsonV@Wandering.shop and GoToSocial at @KelsonV@gts.keysmash.xyz. Book reviews are cross-posted at KelsonReads@BookWyrm.social. Photos at @KelsonV@Pixelfed.social and occasionally @KelsonV@photog.social (Mastodon) is another place I sometimes post photography. Sometimes I hang out at @KelsonV@lemmy.world. Lemmy is a link-sharing/discussion service like Reddit. Postmarks-powered Linkblog / Bookmarks. Other Places You‚Äôll Find Me On my main website you'll find not just my main blog, but tech tips, reviews, and an extensive commentary blog on Les Mis√©rables, among other projects. I have a Gemini Capsule. Speed Force is a comics fan blog following the Flash. Still running (no pun intended), but I don‚Äôt write much for it anymore. I'm occasionally on Bluesky at @kelsonv.bsky.social. And yes, I‚Äôm also on some of the more mainstream social networks, though much less often! Here I am at LinkedIn. (I no longer use Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, though I haven't deleted all my accounts yet.) And I actively contribute to iNaturalist and OpenStreetMap. You May Also Like...
