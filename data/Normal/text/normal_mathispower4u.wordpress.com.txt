If you are interested in my new content posts, I hope you will consider subscribing to my YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/mathispower4u. I will also be keeping my website: https://mathispower4u.com up to date with all new content. I am also planning to hold YouTube Live sessions soon to answer math questions. I am currently working on a way for followers to submit questions before YouTube Lives. Any feedback on this idea is appreciated. Thank you for your support!
