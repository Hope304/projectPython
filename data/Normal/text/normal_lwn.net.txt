[$] Formalizing policy zones for memory [Kernel] Posted Mar 5, 2024 12:49 UTC (Tue) by corbet The kernel's memory-management subsystem is built on the concept of "zones", which were initially added to describe the physical characteristics of the memory pages contained within them. Over time, zones have taken on more of a policy-related role as well. With a patch set called THP allocator optimizations, Yu Zhao has set out to better define the role of policy-related zones on the path toward adding two more of them, with the ultimate purpose of improving the kernel's support for transparent huge pages (THPs).

Eric Snow has been working to make this ability available in the language for many years. Now, Snow has published PEP 734 ("Multiple Interpreters in the Stdlib"), the latest work in his quest, and submitted it to the Python steering council for a decision. If the PEP is approved, users will have an additional option for writing performant parallel Python code.

The rewrite of some of the Elisp in Emacs that uses the Common Lisp library (cl-lib) was started by Richard Stallman as a way to reduce the cognitive load needed for maintaining Emacs itself. Since then, he has broadened his efforts to simplify Elisp by adding a new pattern-matching conditional that would be a competitor to pcase, which is a longstanding macro that he finds overly complex.

As a result, a bug in (for example) an obscure driver may well be exploitable to wreak havoc on core-kernel data structures. Various attempts have been made over the years to increase the degree of isolation within the kernel. The latest of these, "SandBox Mode" proposed by Petr Tesařík, makes it possible for the kernel to run some limited code safely, but it has encountered a bit of a chilly reception.

On February 28 the project announced its "mega release" of KDE Plasma 6, KDE Frameworks 6, and KDE Gear 24.02 — all based on the Qt 6 development framework. This release focuses heavily on migrating to Wayland, and aspires to be a seamless upgrade for the user while improving performance, security, and support for newer hardware. For developers, a lot of work has gone into removing deprecated frameworks and decreasing dependencies to make it easier to write applications targeting KDE. Full Story (comments: 9) [$] A look at Nix and Guix [Distributions] Posted Feb 27, 2024 21:24 UTC (Tue) by daroc Nix and Guix are a pair of unusual package managers based on the idea of declarative configurations. Their associated Linux distributions — NixOS and the Guix System — take the idea further by allowing users to define a single centralized configuration describing the state of the entire system. Both have been previously mentioned on LWN, but not covered extensively. They offer different takes on the central idea of treating packages like immutable values.

Since the consequences of failure in some situations (confidential-computing applications in particular) can be catastrophic, there was some concern about this prospect and what to do about it. Since then, the situation has come a bit more into focus, and there would appear to be an agreed-upon plan for changes to be made to the kernel.

The central concept was to treat documentation as code, which makes it possible to incorporate various tools into documentation workflows in order to maintain high quality. Full Story (comments: 3) [$] Forgejo makes a full break from Gitea [Development] Posted Feb 23, 2024 19:31 UTC (Fri) by jzb The world of open-source "forges" is becoming a little more fragmented. The Forgejo project is a software-development platform that started as a "soft" fork of Gitea in late 2022. On February 16, Forgejo announced its intent to become a "hard fork" of Gitea to help address its mission of community-controlled development and to "liberate software development from the shackles of proprietary tools". In a world where proprietary tools cast a long shadow over open-source development that's a welcome sentiment—if the project can deliver.

Full Story (comments: none) Kernel prepatch 6.8-rc7 [Kernel] Posted Mar 3, 2024 23:03 UTC (Sun) by corbet The 6.8-rc7 kernel prepatch is out for testing. So we finally have a week where things have calmed down, and in fact 6.8-rc7 is smaller than usual at this point in time. So if that keeps up (but that's a fairly notable "if") I won't feel like I need to do an rc8 this release after all. So no guarantees, but assuming no bad surprises, we'll have the final 6.8 next weekend. Comments (none posted) Stable kernels 6.7.8 and 6.6.20 [Kernel] Posted Mar 3, 2024 13:39 UTC (Sun) by corbet The 6.7.8 and 6.6.20 stable kernel updates have been released. They contain a single patch addressing an ntfs3 filesystem build error introduced in the previous round of updates.

It should be appearing in Linux distributions later this year. Back in october, I announced that NVK had reached Vulkan 1.0 conformance on Turing hardware. As of today NVK is now a conformant Vulkan 1.3 implementation on Turing (RTX 2000 and GTX 1600 series), Ampere (RTX 3000 series), and Ada (RTX 4000 series) GPUs. Not only have we jumped forward three Vulkan versions, but the new test runs were done with the GSP firmware enabled and includes Ampere and Ada GPUs. Also, unlike the initial 1.0 run, there are no hacks this time. Every test we passed in those conformance test runs also passes on upstream Mesa.

Full Story (comments: none) Tails 6.0 released [Distributions] Posted Feb 28, 2024 19:24 UTC (Wed) by jzb Tails 6.0 is now available. Based on Debian, Tails is a portable operating system designed to run from a USB stick and help users avoid surveillance and censorship. This release updates most Tails applications, and includes important security and usability improvements. One major new feature in 6.0 is to provide warnings to users about errors when reading or writing to persistent storage. This release now ignores USB devices plugged in while the screen is locked, and removes some file and disk-wiping features from the Files application that are "not reliable enough" on USB sticks and SSDs to continue offering to users. Users of Tails prior to 6.0~rc1 will need to do a manual upgrade to retain persistent storage. New users can download Tails for USB, or as an ISO to create a DVD or run Tails in a virtual machine.
