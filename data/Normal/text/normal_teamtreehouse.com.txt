Take Quiz Success stories with Treehouse Treehouseâ€™s mission is to diversify the tech industry through accessible education, unlocking the door to opportunity, and empowering people to achieve their dreams. Malina Tran New York, New York In nine months, I transformed from being an absolute novice (knowing nothing beyond very fundamental HTML and CSS) to working professionally as a developer. The great thing is that I was learning with Treehouse every step along the way. After getting my feet wet with HTML and CSS, I decided to tackle Ruby, a back-end programming language with syntax that is pretty beginner friendly... Malina's Story Brian Polonia Bronx, New York The Tracks Iâ€™ve done on Treehouse have exposed me to front end web development, full stack JavaScript development, iOS development, Java, Python, and UX/UI Design. While I was completing the Tracks I applied my coding skills to building freelance projects for friends, family, and local business owners... Brian's Story Priscilla Luna Oklahoma City, Oklahoma ...learning to code was fun for me! I remember staying up until 1 am one night working on a project because I was so determined to figure out this one JavaScript function. I was totally hooked. Treehouse played a big role by making the courses easy to absorb, all the while having complete faith in my ability to learn and complete the projects. Priscilla's Story Kalina Edwards Dallas, Texas Well after studying with Treehouse for about a year and a half I was able to land my first coding job in March. It was a short term position for me but I definitely enjoyed the experience being in a full-time web developer role and I learned a great deal. Right now I am enjoying working freelance and seeking out my next opportunity in the coding industry. Kalina's Story Chris Dabatos Tustin, California Not once in my life did I ever think of pursuing coding as a career. Being part of a Filipino family, everyone was either a nurse or a doctor. I wanted to do neither. So for the first 10 years of my adult life, I went from job to job not knowing where my life would end up. So what first encouraged me was realizing that code gave you the ability to choose where you wanted your life to end up. Chris's Story Christina Meyer Zurich, Switzerland Before I knew about Treehouse, I didn't think I could learn how to build a websiteâ€¦ Now, I feel like I can learn anything I want. Learning with Treehouse got me the job I have today and gave me the fundamental knowledge I use on a daily basis. Christian's Story Want to read more inspiring student stories?
