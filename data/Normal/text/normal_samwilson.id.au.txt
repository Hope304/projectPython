The above post should be a sufficient way for me to post a ‘like’, but it’s not yet. If I sort out link previews it might be, but for now it’s a plain URL with nothing. If webmentions were working it would at least send one of them, but they’re not. (Can I even say ‘above’ in a reply and know that the context is clear?)

Superficial minimalism has meant people don’t include archive links, metadata, blogrolls, or even RSS icons. Ruben Schade’s blog is always interesting, and his post today about keeping tags, search, blogrolls, etc. visible on posts’ pages is on form. The idea that the blog format was pretty much figured out in the early days satisfies me, but that’s probably just because I liked it at the time and am starting to feel more of that old “things were fine before and I never really finished figuring them out so do we really have to change already?!” P26704 Sam Wilson 2024 February 28 (Wednesday), 3:19AM Having a good pair of headphones (Sennheiser 450 BT, currently) and a cup of coffee, in a quiet office, and without the summer heat baking the windows, is today making me happy. The ABC has a new(-ish) classical radio station, and the work I’ve been doing on SVG Translate is going well (or at least not breaking). work 📍 · P26703 Sam Wilson 2024 February 27 (Tuesday), 1:53PM I seem to be borking around with my website.

It’s not something that really needs to use it at the moment (it’s just a simple list), but it’ll evolve soon and be more complicated and hopefully end up looking better. Who knows, maybe I’ll learn more of this and get around to helping with moving all that old stuff away from jQuery UI? (The WikiEditor link-insertion dialog comes to mind, because I use that lots). Although I do wonder if I’m doing any of it right. MediaWiki · Vue P26692 Sam Wilson 2023 November 9 (Thursday), 1:40AM I’ve been writing mainly on my other sites (and other people’s sites, like wikis.world), and keep forgetting that I’ve got this site here. Probably no one reads it (or any of my other ones), and I guess that’s why I’ve been neglecting it.
