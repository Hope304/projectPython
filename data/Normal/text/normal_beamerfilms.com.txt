He spoke out boldly against the racist 'Jim Crow laws' and pursued change through a belief in nonviolent protest. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day we honor this baptist minister who often stated that he took his example from the life of Jesus Christ. This is also a great introduction to Black History Month.
