Listen411.com What's new Listen Notes by Numbers 3,304,482 PODCASTS * 190,330,463 EPISODES 26,400,263 SEARCHES 279,091,832 LISTENS * Other websites / apps may claim that they have way more than 3,304,482 podcasts in their database. This is because they inflate the number by including A LOT of 1) podcasts that were already deleted long time ago; 2) super low-quality podcasts (e.g., no episodes at all, only one 10-second episode in the RSS feed for testing, or machine-generated audio); 3) non-audio contents distributed via rss (e.g., RSS feeds with only PDF files, not audio). On the other hand, we deploy automatic scripts (24/7) and human moderators (daily) to clean up data. We try our best to minimize the number of such bad "podcasts" in our database. Search the whole Internet's podcasts. Listeners find ALL podcast episodes interviewing or talking about a person. Journalists do research and find information in podcasts.
