Peer-Reviewed Aging Research Journal Aging is indexed by PubMed/Medline abbreviated as “Aging (Albany NY)”, PubMed Central, Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (abbreviated as Aging‑US and listed in the Cell Biology and Geriatrics & Gerontology categories), and Scopus (abbreviated as Aging and listed in the Cell Biology and Aging categories). Aging publishes research papers in all fields of aging research including but not limited, aging from yeast to mammals, cellular senescence, age-related diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s diseases and their prevention and treatment, anti-aging strategies and drug development and especially the role of signal transduction pathways such as mTOR in aging and potential approaches to modulate these signaling pathways to extend lifespan. The journal aims to promote treatment of age-related diseases by slowing down aging, validation of anti-aging drugs by treating age-related diseases, prevention of cancer by inhibiting aging. Cancer and COVID-19 are age-related diseases. Impact Journals is a member of the Wellcome Trust List of Compliant Publishers. Impact Journals is a member of the Society for Scholarly Publishing.
