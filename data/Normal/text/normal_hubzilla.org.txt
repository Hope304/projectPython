Let's build it together User feedback Haakon Meland Eriksen Stuck at sea? Come fly with me I grew up on the open web. I want it back. The open web is like a town square, open to everyone, people streaming by as you walk along. Maybe you sit down at an outdoor cafÃ© with a friend and you enjoy the scene together. Maybe you want a bit more quiet, so you move inside the cafÃ© at a window table, so you can look out the window while talking with your friends. Maybe you are having a private date, so you move little further into the cafÃ© ... hosh My current use of hubzilla The whole purpose of using hubzilla, rather than other Zot flavors, is to do interesting things with the web, and to use tools like wikis and webpages. That's what I'm trying to do again now. I get terribly embarrassed and confused by the mix of public and private on the web. That happened most recently when I was moving a bunch of posts around and these got shifted by a bot I'd set up on Mastodon into a public timeline. I think that public timelines are one of the most problematic aspects of ... Ian Strasser The Post-Facebook Social Network Imagine a world where you actually have control over every detail of your online presence. Strange to think thatâ€™s actually a real picture we need to paint, but itâ€™s true. This world isnâ€™t some farfetched future, itâ€™s a present opportunity thatâ€™s been in the making for us, for over a decade. Like an unhelpful friend, many authors on this topic have complained about the problems with Facebook, but failed to provide, or act upon any realistic solutions to ... Organisations using Hubzilla News / Roadmap Hubzilla is continuously brought further since 2012 to extend the possibilities of web publishing and of the fediverse. Visit or follow the main developer of Hubzilla to get informed in detail about the new releases. Bridges between fediverse protocols The first Fediverse services federated only in-service via their specific protocol. To connect these isolated galaxies, Mike McGirvin created Hubzilla's predecessor which was called Friendica (intially Mistpark), with its own protocol, but with support for most other protocols, allowing social postings to be sent to and received from other networks (even some commercial services that offer an open interface). Blogging features, WebDAV, CalDAV and CardDAV After Friendica, Mike McGirvin wanted to create something more visionary than a social network, so he developed a network that could handle basically any type of social web content, regulated by a full-fledged access control system, and with sophisticated mechanisms of security, privacy, and ownership. This network was named Redmatrix first and later renamed to Hubzilla, and came with the highly capable protocol Zot. OpenID, remote authentication, nomadic identity Hubzilla got enhanced as an OpenID provider, allowing users to log into OpenID-enabled sites with their Hubzilla channels. The Zot protocol has built in nomadic identity and a mechanism which makes it possible to a server to grant or refuse access to content and actions to identities which are registered on a different hub. Better permissions handling Improved workflow for setting permissions and streamline the way permissions are set across all relevant modules. Improved guest access Improved workflow for dealing with guest access tokens and provide quick access where applicable. Improved page layout editor. Dashboard added. A user interface for the page layout editor was created. The UI allows to drag and drop the building blocks with the mouse. A dashboard which provides a welcome page after login has been added. Various widgets provide an overview of recent activities. Added more functionalites to the dashboard. The dashboard now gives an overview over received posts, divided into public, private and starred ones and those in which the user is mentioned. When it comes to cloud files, wiki pages, photos and webpages, the user sees previews of the most recent created three objects, allowing fast access to them.
