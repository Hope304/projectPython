Child mortality, the death of children under the age of five, is still extremely common in our world today.The historical data makes clear that it doesn’t have to be this way: it is possible for societies to protect their children and reduce child mortality to very low rates. For child mortality to reach low levels, many things have to go right at the same time: good healthcare, good nutrition, clean water and sanitation, maternal health, and high living standards. We can, therefore, think of child mortality as a proxy indicator of a country’s living conditions.The chart shows our long-run data on child mortality, which allows you to see how child mortality has changed in countries around the world.Explore and learn more about this data Explore and learn more about this data Share of population living in extreme povertyWorld BankShare of population living in extreme povertyWorld BankShare of population living in extreme poverty World bankWhat share of the population is living in extreme poverty?The UN sets the “International Poverty Line” as a worldwide comparable definition for extreme poverty. Living in extreme poverty is currently defined as living on less than $2.15 per day. This indicator, published by the World Bank, has successfully drawn attention to the terrible depths of poverty of the poorest people in the world.Two centuries ago, the majority of the world’s population was extremely poor. Back then, it was widely believed that widespread poverty was inevitable. This turned out to be wrong. Economic growth is possible and makes it possible for entire societies to leave the deep poverty of the past behind. Whether or not countries are leaving the worst poverty behind can be monitored by relying on this indicator.Explore and learn more about this data Explore and learn more about this data Life expectancy at birthLong-run estimates collated from multiple sources by Our World in DataLife expectancy at birthLong-run estimates collated from multiple sources by Our World in DataLife expectancy at birth Long-run estimates collated from multiple sources by our world in dataHow has people’s life expectancy changed over time?Across the world, people are living longer. In 1900, the global average life expectancy of a newborn was 32 years. By 2021, this had more than doubled to 71 years.Big improvements were achieved by countries around the world. The chart shows that life expectancy has more than doubled in every region of the world. This improvement is not only due to declining child mortality; life expectancy increased at all ages.This visualization shows long-run estimates of life expectancy brought together by our team from several different data sources. It also shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to reduced life expectancy worldwide.Explore and learn more about this data Explore and learn more about this data Per capita CO₂ emissionsLong-run estimates from the Global Carbon BudgetPer capita CO₂ emissionsLong-run estimates from the Global Carbon BudgetPer capita CO₂ emissions Long-run estimates from the global carbon budgetHow have CO₂ emissions per capita changed?The main source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is the burning of fossil fuels. It is the primary greenhouse gas causing climate change.Globally, CO2 emissions have remained at just below 5 tonnes per person for over a decade. Between countries, however, there are large differences, and while emissions are rapidly increasing in some countries, they are rapidly falling in others.The source for this CO2 data is the Global Carbon Budget, a dataset we update yearly as soon as it is published. In addition to these production-based emissions, they publish consumption-based emissions for the last three decades, which can be viewed in our Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data Explorer.Explore and learn more about this data Explore and learn more about this data GDP per capitaLong-run estimates from the Maddison Project DatabaseGDP per capitaLong-run estimates from the Maddison Project DatabaseGDP per capita Long-run estimates from the maddison project databaseHow do average incomes compare between countries around the world?GDP per capita is a very comprehensive measure of people’s average income. This indicator reveals how large the inequality between people in different countries is. In the poorest countries, people live on less than $1,000 per year, while in rich countries, the average income is more than 50 times higher.The data shown is sourced from the Maddison Project Database. Drawing together the careful work of hundreds of economic historians, the particular value of this data lies in the historical coverage it provides. This data makes clear that the vast majority of people in all countries were poor in the past. It allows us to understand when and how the economic growth that made it possible to leave the deep poverty of the past behind was achieved.Explore and learn more about this data Explore and learn more about this data Share of the population that is undernourishedWorld BankShare of the population that is undernourishedWorld BankShare of the population that is undernourished World bankWhat share of the population is suffering from hunger?Hunger has been a severe problem for most of humanity throughout history. Growing enough food to feed one’s family was a constant struggle in daily life. Food shortages, malnutrition, and famines were common around the world.The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization publishes global data on undernourishment, defined as not consuming enough calories to maintain a normal, active, healthy life. These minimum requirements vary by a person’s sex, weight, height, and activity levels. This is considered in these national and global estimates.The world has made much progress in reducing global hunger in recent decades. But we are still far away from an end to hunger, as this indicator shows. Tragically, nearly one in ten people still do not get enough food to eat and in recent years — especially during the pandemic — hunger levels have increased.Explore and learn more about this data Explore and learn more about this data Literacy rateLong-run estimates collated from multiple sources by Our World in DataLiteracy rateLong-run estimates collated from multiple sources by Our World in DataLiteracy rate Long-run estimates collated from multiple sources by our world in dataWhen has literacy become a widespread skill?Literacy is a foundational skill. Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. When we fail to teach this foundational skill, people have fewer opportunities to lead the rich and interesting lives that a good education offers.The historical data shows that only a very small share of the population, a tiny elite, was able to read and write. Over the course of the last few generations, literacy levels increased, but it remains an important challenge for our time to provide this foundational skill to all.At Our World in Data, we investigated the strengths and shortcomings of the available data on literacy. Based on this work, our team brought together the long-run data shown in the chart by combining several different sources, including the World Bank, the CIA Factbook, and a range of research publications.Explore and learn more about this data Explore and learn more about this data Share of the population with access to electricityWorld BankShare of the population with access to electricityWorld BankShare of the population with access to electricity World bankWhere do people lack access to even the most basic electricity supply?Light at night makes it possible to get together after sunset; mobile phones allow us to stay in touch with those far away; the refrigeration of food reduces food waste; and household appliances free up time from household chores. Access to electricity improves people’s living conditions in many ways.The World Bank data on the world map captures whether people have access to the most basic electricity supply — just enough to provide basic lighting and charge a phone or power a radio for 4 hours per day.It shows that, especially in several African countries, a large share of the population lacks the benefits that basic electricity offers. No radio and no light at night.Explore and learn more about this data Explore and learn more about this data Data explorersSee all our Data Explorers Interactive visualization tools to explore a wide range of related indicators.Poverty Data ExplorerPopulation & Demography Data ExplorerGlobal Health Data ExplorerEnergy Data ExplorerSubscribe to our newsletterReceive our latest work by email.Immediate updatesReceive an email from us whenever we publish new work (maximum 1 per day).Biweekly digestReceive an overview of our recent work and highlights of our other work every two weeks.SubscribeBy subscribing you are agreeing to the terms of our privacy policy.Follow usXFacebookInstagramThreadsRSS FeedAll our topicsAll our data, research, and writing — topic by topic.Population and Demographic ChangePopulation Change:Population GrowthAge StructureGender RatioBirths and Deaths:Life ExpectancyChild and Infant MortalityFertility RateGeography of the World Population:UrbanizationMigrationHealthHealth Risks:Lead PollutionAlcohol ConsumptionOpioids, Cocaine, Cannabis, and Other Illicit DrugsAir PollutionOutdoor Air PollutionIndoor Air PollutionObesitySmokingInfectious Diseases:Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)PandemicsMpox (monkeypox)HIV / AIDSMalariaDiarrheal DiseasesInfluenzaTuberculosisPolioPneumoniaTetanusSmallpoxHealth Institutions and Interventions:VaccinationHealthcare SpendingEradication of DiseasesLife and Death:Life ExpectancyCauses of DeathChild and Infant MortalityMental HealthSuicidesCardiovascular DiseasesBurden of DiseaseCancerMaternal MortalityGlobal HealthEnergy and EnvironmentEnergy Systems:Access to EnergyFossil FuelsRenewable EnergyEnergyNuclear EnergyWaste and Pollution:Plastic PollutionOil SpillsLead PollutionClimate and Air:CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas EmissionsClimate ChangeOzone LayerAir PollutionOutdoor Air PollutionIndoor Air PollutionWater:Clean Water and SanitationClean WaterSanitationWater Use and StressEnvironment and Ecosystems:Natural DisastersBiodiversityEnvironmental Impacts of Food ProductionAnimal WelfareForests and DeforestationLand UseFood and AgricultureNutrition:Hunger and UndernourishmentFood SupplyFood PricesDiet CompositionsObesityHuman HeightMicronutrient DeficiencyFaminesFood Production:Agricultural ProductionEnvironmental Impacts of Food ProductionAnimal WelfareCrop YieldsMeat and Dairy ProductionFarm Size and ProductivityAgricultural Inputs:FertilizersPesticidesEmployment in AgricultureLand UsePoverty and Economic DevelopmentPublic Sector:State CapacityTaxationGovernment SpendingHealthcare SpendingEducation SpendingMilitary Personnel and SpendingCorruptionPoverty and Prosperity:PovertyEconomic InequalityEconomic GrowthEconomic Inequality by GenderLabor:Child LaborWorking HoursWomen’s EmploymentGlobal Connections:TourismMigrationTrade and GlobalizationEducation and KnowledgeEducation:Global EducationLiteracyEducation SpendingKnowledge:Research and DevelopmentInternetBooksInnovation and Technological ChangeArtificial IntelligenceSpace Exploration and SatellitesInternetResearch and DevelopmentTechnological ChangeTransportLiving Conditions, Community, and WellbeingHousing and Infrastructure:Access to EnergyLight at NightClean Water and SanitationClean WaterSanitationIndoor Air PollutionHomelessnessTime Use:Time UseWorking HoursRelationships:Marriages and DivorcesLoneliness and Social ConnectionsTrustHappiness and Wellbeing:Human Development Index (HDI)Happiness and Life SatisfactionHuman Rights and DemocracyHuman RightsDemocracyState CapacityWomen’s RightsLGBT+ RightsEconomic Inequality by GenderViolence Against Children and Children’s RightsChild LaborViolence and WarWar and PeaceNuclear WeaponsHomicidesTerrorismState CapacityMilitary Personnel and SpendingBiological and Chemical WeaponsViolence Against Children and Children’s RightsOur World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.Help us do this work by making a donation.Donate nowAboutContactFeedbackJobsFundingHow to useDonatePrivacy policyLatest workAll chartsTwitterFacebookInstagramThreadsGitHubRSS FeedLicenses: All visualizations, data, and articles produced by Our World in Data are open access under the Creative Commons BY license.
