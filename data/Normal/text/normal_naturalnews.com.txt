I reserve the right to disagree with Trump at any time, and I'm not afraid to call him out when he's wrong, even though I plan to vote for him. But Trump is also capable of making huge anti-liberty mistakes such as supporting the bump stock ban, or fast-tracking the deadly depopulation jab through Operation Warp Speed. If we surrender our ability to call out mistakes made by the people who represent us, then we become oblivious sheeple rather than independent-minded citizens. Do not give in to the blob. Don't compromise your principles just to get on a platform or get some clicks (or funds). Stick to your principles and stay the course. Think for yourself. Tribalism is not the solution. Independent thinking is what will connect us to truth and liberty. - Mike Adams (4/4) Mike Adams The Health RangerMar 05 For example, many members of this group of publishers and broadcasters have their heads so deeply embedded in Israel's rectum that they have abandoned their "pro-life" camouflage in order to support the ongoing genocide against Palestinians. If they had principles, they would be pro-life for Palestinian civilians, but they aren't dedicated to principles they are dedicated to their TRIBE. It is this tribalism that has long characterized the tyrannical Left, and now I'm beginning to see the early signs of the rise of right-wing tribalism that is, in many ways, just as disturbing. True independent thinkers and journalists are simply not welcomed anywhere on the major platforms or shows these days. Most platforms demand obedience to a particular set of contrived narratives, or you are punished or de-platformed. The Brighteon platforms truly stand as rare examples of defending the freedom to speak and the freedom to think. From Brighteon Social, Brighteon TV and Brighteon dot com, and soon Brighteon AI, we strive to build infrastructure that supports human freedom and critical thinking. (3/4) Mike Adams The Health RangerMar 05 @ZeroHedge for example stubbornly refuses to link to any of the outstanding interviews broadcast on Brighteon TV from top-notch analysts like Jeffrey Prather, and very few outlets in the MAM will cover my own pivotal interviews with people like Dr. Michael Nehls ("The Indoctrinated Brain") or Robert Kiyosaki (on Decentralize TV). Meanwhile, X (Twitter) still censors Brighteon links, and X shadow bans both my own account (@HealthRanger) as well as accounts from Alex Jones and InfoWars, which has also been routinely suppressed and shadow banned, even by so-called "patriots." What we are witnessing here is the rise of heavily-funded, agenda-driven "alternative" conservative media, which is no more principled than left-wing corporate media and cares nothing about the real truth of what's happening in our world.
