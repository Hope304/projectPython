Scott Hanselman - Coder, Blogger, Teacher, Speaker, Author Scott Hanselman about blog podcast youtube newsletter speaking Hi, I'm Scott I'm a teacher. I speak all over to whoever will listen. I have written code that you've used. I've been blogging for over a decade, coding for twice that, and podcasting for over half that. I code, write, speak, empower, promote, braid, learn and listen - usually not in that order. Find me on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Mastodon!
