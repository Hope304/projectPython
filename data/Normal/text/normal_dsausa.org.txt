We believe that working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few. What we do We are a political and activist organization, not a party; through campus and community-based chapters, DSA members use a variety of tactics, from legislative to direct action, to fight for reforms that empower working people. Learn More about Democratic Socialism Get Involved The Democratic Socialists of America is the largest socialist organization in the United States because we‚Äôre a member-driven mass organization. We believe that working people should run both the economy and civil society, and we show our commitment to this principle by being an organization of, by, and for the working class. Our Campaign Priorities DSA and YDSA chapters organize around various issues, striving to run strategic campaigns based on local conditions. Nationally, we we also provide resources and support for work done as part of our major priorities as democratically voted upon: Electoral Strategy Bernie Sanders launched a political revolution and DSA continues to build it, training our chapters to effectively support democratic socialist candidates running for local and state office while lifting up our key issues. We‚Äôre also grappling with how to build independent political power to hold elected officials accountable to their constituents rather than the donor class. Learn More Strong Labor Movement Capitalism pits us against each other and workplaces are fundamentally authoritarian unless workers can self-organize and build collective power. This is why people build unions, and why employers undermine them. It is also why the capitalists as a class constantly promote narratives about unions that frame them as unnecessary, undemocratic, or ineffective. We know better, and we‚Äôre building worker power in every region of the country. Learn More Green New Deal The climate crisis is an emergency. The world‚Äôs top scientists are saying we have little time to get off fossil fuels. Meanwhile, inequality is already out of control ‚Äî and rising. We fight for a Green New Deal because it‚Äôs the only plan that meets the scale of the crisis, one that puts people and planet over profit to build a more just and sustainable economy. We‚Äôre organizing in our workplaces, communities and schools to build the working class movement it will take to win.

The National Jobs for All Network‚Äôs Full Count shows that the real unemployment rate in August was 8.7%, not 3.8%. There are 15 million people who are unemployed or underemployed at part-time jobs because they cannot get full-time work. Whether or not the official unemployment rate goes up or down a little may suggest job market trends, but it does not tell us how far away we are from real full employment.
