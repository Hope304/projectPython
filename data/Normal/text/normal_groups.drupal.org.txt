Browse groups Geographical Working groups Distribution Event planning Drupal 9 Porting Weekend May 22-23, 2020 Posted by Gábor Hojtsy on May 5, 2020 at 7:26pm Start: 2020-05-21 23:30 - 2020-05-24 03:30 UTC Organizers: Gábor Hojtsy Event type: Sprint Join the Drupal Community in this worldwide event focusing on Drupal 9 stability and adoption across contributed projects. Over 1600 projects are already Drupal 9 compatible a month before Drupal 9's release which is unprecedented. However, there are still thousands that only need very small changes and a release made. The first Drupal 9 Porting Day was on April 28, 2020, led by Gábor Hojtsy, Lee Rowlands, Vladimir Roudakov, QED42, Srijan, Adam Bergstein and Mike Lutz. Altogether 126 issues were worked on that resulted in 89 newly Drupal 9 compatible releases on that day and the following two days. It was not only successful but we had a lot of fun too. So we are of course here to do another one this month! Read more Drupal 9.0.0-beta1 has been released! Posted by xjm on March 20, 2020 at 8:39pm Huge thanks for responding to our call for contributors posted at the beginning of the month. All must-have beta requirements have been completed, so, we've released Drupal 9.0.0-beta1! Drupal 8.9.0-beta1 will be released next week (the week of March 23). Read more Status of Drupal 9.0.0-beta1: a March beta is still possible Posted by xjm on March 3, 2020 at 6:41pm This week is the first target release window for the Drupal 9 beta. We’ve made significant progress on the beta requirements during the last couple of months thanks to the tremendous amount of work by the community. Based on the outstanding tasks in the meta issue, we are close to completing beta requirements, but not close enough to release it this week. When will Drupal 9.0.0-beta1 be released? Given how close we are to completing the beta requirements, we are considering releasing the beta in mid-March if the requirements are complete by March 13. If we do release the beta in 1-2 weeks, Drupal 9.0.0 will still be scheduled for release on June 3, 2020. We will make a final announcement by March 16 about whether there will be a June release. If any must-have issues remain unresolved by March 13, we will move the beta target window to the first week of May, and Drupal 9.0.0 will be scheduled for August 3, 2020. Read more Drupal 9 meetings now every Monday at 7pm UTC, help us prepare for beta! Posted by Gábor Hojtsy on January 9, 2020 at 5:34pm We started the "All things Drupal 9" meetings all the way back in October 2018 to start preparing for the new major release. Now in 2020, the year of Drupal 9, it was natural to make the meeting happen every Monday given the target dates coming up fast. Contributed project maintainers, site owners, core developers are all welcome. If you are planning a Drupal 9 project for later in the year, this is your place as well. We open the floor with equal opportunity for people to propose topics, so we can cover your pressing questions as well! Join at 7pm UTC in the #d9readiness channel on Drupal Slack any Monday. The next meeting will be on January 13th, 2020. We've been promoting Drupal 9's June 3rd 2020 target release date a lot, but that can only happen if the Drupal 9.0.0 beta requirements are all done by the end of February 2020, which is coming up real fast. There are still a lot to do and we need your help! If that does not happen, then the release will happen in August or December. While that would give less time for Drupal 8 users to update, we cannot compromise on the stability of Drupal 9 out of the gate.

Those reports are all based on the same source. The source investigated the contents of CHANGELOG.txt of a large number of sites and assumed all sites reporting a version lower than 7.58 to be vulnerable. Read more Have your say in where Drupal 8 is going by participating in key initiatives Posted by Gábor Hojtsy on April 24, 2018 at 2:26pm Maybe you have seen Dries Buytaert's DrupalCon keynote and are looking forward to all the goodies coming in future Drupal 8 versions. The truth is none of those things will happen without people who want to make them happen to solve their own challenges with implementing and showcasing Drupal solutions. Are you implementing decoupled solutions and have issues you are working on? In the middle of building up a suite of integrated media solutions? These core team meetings are ideal to bring in these issues and discuss solutions and to be part of shaping up where Drupal 8 is heading. Read on for details.
