I felt welcomed and reassured the moment I booked my initial consultation for rhinoplasty. My procedure went smoothly and the after care is unparalleled! Thank you Dr. Dickie, Dr. Taylor, Janet, Carol, Shawnie and Kim.” RateMD – May 2018 “Dr. Dickie, Shawnie and the team provided me excellent patient care & service. They were all very professional, thoughtful, caring, and demonstrated this to me recently by ensuring my questions and concerns were addressed before, during and after my surgery. The care I received on the day of surgery ( Breast Lift & Augmentation) and during my recovery period was the BEST CARE I could receive. Two months post surgery and I feel I’ve recovered completely based on what I see and how I feel, although I understand it will take 6-12 months for full recovery. I have and will continue to recommend Dr. Dickie and his team, as my #1 choice.” RateMD – August 2018 “Dr Dickey did my breast augmentation. He and his wife make a great team and all the staff are amazing there. My experience before and after surgery was A+. I couldn’t have been more happy with the results.” RateMD – September 2018 “Both my rhinoplasty surgery as well as thigh lift came out amazing. He is a very kind and caring surgeon and his skills are outstanding. My scars are light and thin and in some places hard to detect! How cool is That?! and I have healed faster from his surgeries then I ever did from other surgeries. I have tried other surgeons and have been hugely disappointed. With Dr. Dickie I am very very happy with my results. His Staff is so professional, but very kind. Will ALWAYS trust this Surgeon and no others, from now on.” RateMD – November 2018 “Shawnie is absolutely amazing!! I have already recommended Royal Centre of Plastic Surgery to my friends and family who are looking to have any work done. They are amazing, understanding and truly care about their patients.” – Carrie Allen Google Review – June 2018 “Wow the product for increasing fullness to your own lashes is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. ladies u gotta have this, stop by and ask about fullness to your own lashes they will hook you up!!! Thx so much ladies!!!” – Theresa Parish Google Review – June 2018 “Dr Dickie and his staff are incredible. You can trust them and be assured that the outcome will be exactly what you hoped for. I have had three procedures done by him now and couldn’t be happier with the results. He is a gifted and skilled surgeon, full of experience and knowledge that you just can’t find with other plastic surgeons. He gave me back my body and I can’t thank him enough!” – Violet Aston Google Review – February 2018 “I am now 5 months post-op from breast augmentation. Both Dr. Dickie and his wife are fantastic amd fabulous. They really care about the quality of work and their patients. It’s been 5 months and people at the clinic still know me by name (not just as a patient). I am beyond happy with the results. I cannot brag enough about this place. If I get more cosmetic work later on in my life, I will be going to this place. Amazing team :)!!” – Cassandra Hill Google Review – May 2018 RealSelf Patient Reviews of Kenneth Dickie, MD, FRCSC Do it for You.
