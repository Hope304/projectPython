Custom Built Solutions Compliance & Security Benefits Industry Lowest Fees Learn About Guru Enterprise What Clients Say In our company, we do ongoing research with our target audience. This includes 30-45 minute phone interviews. It was difficult to conduct the interview, really listen, and ask good follow up questions while trying to capture it all in thorough hand-written notes. One of our writers suggested using Guru to find someone to transcribe these interviews...The person I hired is the one I’ve stuck with for nearly two years now – she is fast, accurate, and affordable. I’d never have found her on my own, given that I live in Utah and she lives in South Africa. I could never have arranged such an effective solution to my on-going need for transcripts without Guru. It’s been a life-saver. Ed Bagley Director of Product Marketing, O.C. Tanner Company Scopic Software has been on Guru since its founding in 2006. We are now over 200 employees and Guru is still our primary source of new clients. We would not be where we are today without Guru. It is definitely the best service marketplace out there if you are looking to grow a company, either as a buyer or provider. Guru is not only a marketplace but a place to do business. We meet new clients and more often than not establish long-term business relationships, all through Guru. The flexibility in how projects can be structured and the many payment options available allows us to work with clients in a way they feel most comfortable. We have been with Guru for over 10 years and hope to be here much longer. Scopic Software Custom IT Solutions Firm Guru's services have allowed me to find more freelancing work as a writer than any other website. It is easy to communicate with clients through their message system and their SafePay feature ensures that all funds are secured prior to any work being done. I would recommend Guru to any freelancer who is looking to find new clients online. Russell Lee Writer At SOLACE Engineers, we provide engineering solutions and other services on various freelancing platforms. Among them all, Guru is the best and our first choice to invite clients outside of freelancing platforms. Great customer support, low fee, easy to understand interface and solid payment protection with the SafePay system make working a delight on Guru! Guru really helped our business flourish… Solace Engineers Inc. Engineering Firm Guru.com is my favorite freelance platform. I love the functionality, the support and the strong workflow element, particularly the SafePay feature which makes the transfer of funds so easy. I love the integration with PayPal and the ability to amend agreements, with all steps communicated to and actioned by both sides. Of all the freelance platforms I have used, Guru is by far my favorite. Isabel Austin Writer, Editor, Proofreader Guru has been so helpful in growing my business in an industry that is tough to get into! Not only can I apply for endless amounts of gigs that I feel I am a match for...but potential clients can invite me to apply for gigs which has brought me a lot of success. I love how it connects people from all over the world and gives us an opportunity to work together on just about any project imaginable. I am excited to continue growing my business here! Ella Rogue Singer, Songwriter As the CEO of www.taxconnections.com, I looked all over the world for someone I could trust to handle our servers and databases. Nix Solutions Ltd. has delivered support for all our servers in the cloud for several years now and they are amazing. As I talked to other service providers who wanted to charge me 10X more I was stunned and pleasantly surprised to discover Nix Solutions Ltd at their low prices. They have continuously provided outstanding service 24/7 which I am forever grateful. These guys do it all and I would advise any CEO that Nix Solutions Ltd. will exceed their expectations. Also, I should add we discovered Nix Solutions Ltd. only through Guru.com which makes me very happy with your organization, too. Thank you for facilitating the connection.
