wonko.com Hi, I'm Ryan Grove I write code. I love movies and pie! I live in Portland, Oregon with a co-protagonist and a lot of computers. I work on frontend platforms, infrastructure, and lots of other stuff at SmugMug. Previously I co-founded and led engineering at Cake, built and eventually retired RawGit, and worked on Yahoo Search and the YUI JavaScript framework at Yahoo. Before that I did various other things at various other companies. You can find me in these places: I'm @yaypie@pie.gd on Mastodon I'm @pie.gd on Bluesky I'm rgrove on GitHub I write about movies on Letterboxd I share photos on SmugMug and Flickr I've written a few things on Medium I don't use Twitter anymore, but I was @yaypie there for many years One neat thing many of those sites have in common is that they rely on open source code I wrote.
