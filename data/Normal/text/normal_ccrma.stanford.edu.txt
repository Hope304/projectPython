CCRMA WAVE (Wall for AudioVisual Expression) presents Chris Lortie: Symptom of Expression Upcoming Events A Bayesian model of auditory performance Date: Fri, 03/15/2024 - 10:30am - 12:00pm Location: CCRMA Seminar Room Event Type: Hearing Seminar The auditory system is large and complex. We'll never have enough tests to fully characterize it. Can Bayesian modeling help, summarizing what we know, and providing probability distributions for the parts we do not know? Malcolm Slaney will provide an introduction to Bayesian modeling and describe a first-ever probabilistic model of speech perception performance in noise. This is work in progress, so lots of questions are appropriate. Open to the Public Ludmila Yurina Date: Thu, 03/28/2024 - 7:30pm - 9:00pm Location: CCRMA Stage / CCRMA LIVE Event Type: Concert Ukrainian pianist and composer Ludmila Yurina presents new works from her Visiting Scholar residency at CCRMA. FREE and Open to the Public | In Person + Livestream Christine Evers on Embodied Audio Date: Tue, 04/09/2024 - 10:30am - 12:00pm Location: CCRMA Seminar Room Event Type: Hearing Seminar Tentative time. Prof. Christine Evers from Southhampton will be talking about embodied audio, or how to teach (noisy) robots how to hear. FREE Open to the Public Lloyd May on Audio Processing Strategies to Enhance Cochlear Implant Users' Music Enjoyment Date: Fri, 04/26/2024 - 10:30am - 12:00pm Location: CCRMA Seminar Room Event Type: Hearing Seminar Cochlear implants are a brutal solution to a hard problem. How do you electrically stimulate the auditory system to convey sound to people who are otherwise deaf? They work well enough to allow people to understand speech. It's really quite remarkable. But what about music? What might we do to encode music so that people with cochlear implants can enjoy it? Who: Lloyd May (CCRMA) What: Designing Audio Processing Strategies to Enhance Cochlear Implant Users' Music Enjoyment Abstract: FREE Open to the Public Recent Events Quarantine Sessions #118 Date: Sun, 02/25/2024 - 1:00pm - 2:00pm Location: CCRMA Stage / CCRMA LIVE Event Type: Concert The telematic improvisation series started at the beginning of the pandemic is finally bringing some of its core members and guests to the CCRMA Stage, performing together with the other musicians remotely, and inviting an audience to join them in person for the first time. FREE and Open to the Public | In Person + Livestream A Tour of the Auditory System Courtesy of Eric Young Date: Fri, 02/23/2024 - 10:30am - 12:00pm Location: CCRMA Seminar Room Event Type: Hearing Seminar Murray Sachs and Eric Young collected an amazing set of data from the auditory nerve of cats. They played vowel-like sounds to cats and recorded from a large number of auditory nerve fibers. The assembled data tells us a LOT about how the auditory system works. We recently lost Eric Young, as noted below. I’d like to use this Hearing Seminar to honor Eric and his data, and tell his story about how the auditory system works. FREE Open to the Public Synthetic Realms Date: Thu, 02/22/2024 - 7:30pm - 9:00pm Location: CCRMA Stage / CCRMA LIVE Event Type: Concert Join us for a combined program of audiovisual compositions by Constantin Basica and Andrew A. Watts. The works ponder on futuristic issues related to artificial intelligence, time travel and time loops, postapocalyptic visions, the multiverse, and the end of our known universe. Eda Er and Adrián Montúfar | Stanford - UC Berkeley Composition Exchange Concert Date: Tue, 02/20/2024 - 6:00pm - 7:00pm Location: CCRMA Stage Event Type: Concert Eda Er and Adrián Montúfar will perform in a concert as part of the Stanford - UC Berkeley Composition Exchange. Adrián is joined by Hallie Smith to play as a duo.
