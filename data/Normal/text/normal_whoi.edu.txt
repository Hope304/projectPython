In the spirit of the day, we‚Äôd like to give a shout-out to Kelpwatch, an innovative, open-source platform for monitoring changes in #kelp canopy from the Pacific Coast of North America to Argentina‚Äôs Atlantic Coast‚Äì and soon to be followed by South Africa and other countries. This free resources is a collaboration between researchers at #WHOI, @nasa, @ucla, @ucsantabarbara, and @nature_org‚Å†‚Å†Kelp forests provide habitat and food for thousands of species, including sea otters, rockfish, and sea lions. But warming waters, pollution, and overharvesting are threatening these critical marine ecosystems. Kelpwatch‚Äôs user-friendly maps, based on 35 years of remote sensing data, offer a cost-effective way to research kelp forests and develop science-based management plans for them.‚Å†‚Å†See for yourself at Kelpwatch.org!‚Å†‚Å†#WWD2024 #DigitalInnovation #TechForWildlife #HelptheKelp‚Å†‚Å†üì∏ by Stefan Andrews ¬© @theoceanagency‚Å†‚Å†‚Å† Mar 3 Open whoi.ocean It‚Äôs #WorldSeagrassDay!‚Å†‚Å†üê† üê¢üê¨ As one of the most widespread coastal habitats on Earth, #seagrass meadows sustain some of the world‚Äôs largest fisheries, as well as provide food and shelter for turtles, marine mammals, seahorses, shellfish and crustaceans. These submerged meadows also act as natural water filters, keeping pollutants out of our seafood and protecting vulnerable coral reefs. Seagrass meadows store up to 18% of the carbon in the ocean and act as the first line of defense against coastal floods and storms.‚Å†‚Å†Despite all these incredible benefits, about a third of the seagrass around the world has disappeared. ‚ÄúGlobally, a soccer field of seagrass is lost every 30 minutes,‚Äù says #WHOI marine chemist Matt Long, ‚Äúand we lose about 5-10% at an accelerated rate every single year.‚Äù‚Å†‚Å†üì≤ Drift over to the link in our profile to read a @nytimes story on restoring seagrass, one blade at a time.‚Å†‚Å†üì∏ by Matt Long ¬© Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution‚Å†‚Å† Mar 1 Open whoi.ocean Happy #LeapDay!‚Å†‚Å†Small steps in marine science lead to giant leaps in understanding our ocean planet.‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†üì∏: MIT-WHOI graduate student Laura Stevens jumps over a stream of #meltwater on the #Greenland Ice Sheet during a 2010 study that identified a mechanism that triggers cracks in the ice, causing #glaciers to shed more rapidly into the ocean by Sarah Das @snowintosea; Pacific white-sided #dolphins play in the wake of @rvatlantis by Lance Willis; Adelie #penguins line up at the icy diving board by Chris Linder; a #humpback #whale breaches @stellwagenbanknms by Melissa Patrician. ‚Å†‚Å†All images ¬© Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution‚Å†‚Å† Feb 29 Open whoi.ocean #Throwback to a port stop in Godthaab, #Greenland in 1962! Before setting out for a research cruise on the Danish vessel Erika Dan (pictured here in port), #WHOI physical oceanographers Val Worthington and Redwood Wright took some time to go sledding with local kids using metal hydrophone covers. Wright also took these incredible shots of Greenland‚Äôs capital city, which is now called #Nuuk.‚Å†‚Å†On their cruise from Cape Farewell, Greenland to southeastern Labrador, the researchers took oxygen, temperature and salinity measurements. These deep sea measurements were some of the first ever recorded in the area, and added to a growing ‚Äúatlas‚Äù of deep ocean circulation in the North Atlantic, which was still not well understood at the time. ‚Å†‚Å†üì∏ by Redwood Wright ¬© Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution‚Å†‚Å† Feb 29 Open whoi.ocean üéâ Alvin pilot Rick Sanger passed a major #milestone today, completing his 50th dive in the human-occupied submersible!‚Å†‚Å†Since September 2022, Sanger has piloted the iconic research sub to #deepsea locations around the world. Today`s dive took place at the East Pacific Rise, a fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge. Scientists from #WHOI and @lehighu think a volcanic eruption in the area is likely within the next few years, and are taking chemical measurements and vent fluid samples with #HOVAlvin to study the process.‚Å†‚Å†üì∏ courtesy of Dan Fornari ¬© Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution‚Å†‚Å†#NSFfunded #EPRLavaWatch Feb 28 Open whoi.ocean A marine #isopod dines on a mantis shrimp in a collecting tank. A relative of land-based pill bugs or roly-polys, there are thousands of these types of #crustacean in the #ocean. Some are scavengers, some are parasites, and some are filter-feeders, but they all play an important role in the carbon cycle that keeps our climate habitable.This isopod was collected during a research cruise to the Northeast US Shelf Long-term Ecological Research Station as part of an effort to study #zooplankton along the highly productive continental shelf.üì∏ by Daniel Cojanu ¬© #WHOI#WeirdOcean #KeepItWeird #NSFfunded@lter_community @nsfgov Feb 28 Open OUR WORK WHOI is at the forefront of groundbreaking science and technology development, unlocking the mysteries of our ocean, its connections to life on Earth, and solutions it may hold to some of our most pressing environmental challenges. RESEARCH Our scientists and engineers lead more than 800 concurrent projects, tackling some of the most challenging and important problems of our time, from climate change and ocean pollution to sustainable food and energy production. EXPLORATION We operate a fleet of research vessels and vehicles, including two large ships (R/V Neil Armstrong and R/V Atlantis), a smaller coastal research vessel, the iconic human-occupied submersible Alvin, and dozens of other underwater robots. EDUCATION Through our higher education programs, including the prestigious MIT-WHOI Joint Program, we train new generations of ocean scientists, engineers, and leaders-providing access to cutting edge facilities and unparalleled access to the sea. CONNECTION WHOI plays a leading role in ocean communications, sharing our insights and knowledge about the ocean to the general public, policymakers, educators, and more, so we can make wise decisions about our ocean, our planet, and our future. FEATURED PROJECTS We have over 1,000 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support staff working around the globe and cutting edge laboratories to push the boundaries of knowledge about the ocean.
