Our mission is to create the best radiology reference, and to make it available for free, forever. Find out more here or watch the history of Radiopaedia video below. Impact Since its inception in 2005, Radiopaedia has grown to become one of the most important medical resources for literally millions of individuals from around the world, particularly those from low and middle-income regions who do not have access to traditional pay-wall resources. Find out stats and stories. Content types Radiopaedia comprises three fundamental content types (articles, cases and multiple-choice questions).​ Articles Articles seek to provide a comprehensive review of topics relevant to the practice of radiology. Every contribution is valuable, and peer-reviewed by our editorial board, so we encourage you to share your knowledge and expertise. Together, we can create an unparalleled resource for the radiology community. See: Editing Radiopaedia Articles Learning Pathway Cases Cases are part of your personal case library. You are encouraged to share your cases with the community where they can be used to illustrate articles or be featured in questions. You can also collate cases into playlists to facilitate self-learning and teaching. See: Creating Cases Learning Pathway Multiple choice questions Questions are relatively new to Radiopaedia but we have big plans for them. For now, questions are shown at the bottom of articles and used in our virtual conferences and courses. You can also find them when searching the site. See: Creating Multiple Choice Questions Learning Pathway Editorial standards Radiopaedia's peer-review policy and CME program are overseen by the Radiopaedia Educational Board. All contributions to articles, cases and multiple-choice questions are peer-reviewed by our dedicated Editorial board.
