On the San Mateo County Coastside, our mission expands to include acquiring and preserving agricultural land of regional significance, to preserve rural character, and to encourage viable agricultural use of land resources. Image Preserve & Protect We preserve open space lands to protect coastal prairies, redwood forests, green foothills, oak woodlands, salmonid streams, bayland salt marshes and more, creating an interconnected landscape of healthy nature. Image Care For Preserving land is no longer enough. After decades of intensive human use, climate change, drought and the increased risk of wildland fire make active management critical to protect the habitat values of our public lands. (Opens in new window)Image Educate Midpen offers a variety of opportunities to connect people to open space. Learning about local places, plants and animals can help us appreciate the importance of these landscapes and our role in keeping them healthy. Image Enjoy To many of us, open space means recreation and, indeed, Midpen preserves feature 250 miles of trails to explore on foot. More than half (150+ miles) are multiuse trails, also open to bicycles and horseback riding. Discover Your Preserves Get outside and connect with nature.

Room to Breathe Open Space for All Know Before You Go Recreate Responsibly Share the Space Image Bobcat (David Henry) Room to BreatheWhen you visit a Midpen preserve, you immediately may notice the differences from other city or county parks that you have visited. There is scenic beauty to absorb and wild landscapes to explore. Parking areas are generally small and amenities typically few and rustic. While visiting, it is important to remember that these public open space lands are being actively managed to protect natural resources, restore native habitats, encourage biodiversity and increase the region's resilience to climate change. By providing opportunities for ecologically sensitive public enjoyment and education, Midpen preserves offer people room to breathe and connections with nature, while giving plants and animals a chance to thrive.

Explore your preserves Image Hikers at vista in Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve (Robin Lord) Know Before You GoIf you've ever become lost or run out of water, you've learned that being unprepared for a visit to an open space can lead to stressful, even dangerous, situations. The best way to avoid such a situation is to prepare. Plan your day before you leave home and check the weather. Please be sure to download a map, no matter how short you think your visit will be, and bring your phone even if you don't know if you will have service. Wear sturdy, comfortable shoes. Pack a bag with plenty of water, snacks, layers for different weather and sun protection. And always have a trash bag with you so that you leave nothing behind at the end of your visit. Be prepared Image Mountain Biker on Spring Ridge Trail in Windy Hill Open Space Preserve (Todd Scheuer) Recreate ResponsiblyWhen we care for the land, the land cares for us, providing tangible and intangible benefits like clean air and water, flood protection and the opportunity for restorative experiences in nature. This requires us all to do our part. For example, staying on designated trails prevents erosion and the spread of nonnative invasive plant seeds, as well as plant diseases like Sudden Oak Death. Please leave ecosystems whole by taking photos, rather than flowers. Help keep wildlife wild by maintaining distance from animals you may encounter and never feeding any wild animals. Disposing of waste properly, including organic waste like fruit peels and pits, helps discourage animals from frequenting areas where people are and prevents dangerous situations for both. Tips on how to prepare for an outdoor adventure Image Equestrian at Russian Ridge Open Space Preserve (Kathy Beyer) Share the SpaceAt Midpen, we believe open space is for all.
