The Stanford NLP Group Welcome to the Natural Language Processing Group at Stanford University! We are a passionate, inclusive group of students and faculty, postdocs and research engineers, who work together on algorithms that allow computers to process, generate, and understand human languages. Our interests are very broad, including basic scientific research on computational linguistics, machine learning, practical applications of human language technology, and interdisciplinary work in computational social science and cognitive science. We also develop a wide variety of educational materials on NLP and many tools for the community to use, including the Stanza toolkit which processes text in over 60 human languages. The Stanford NLP Group is part of the Stanford AI Lab (SAIL), and we also have close associations with the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), the Center for Research on Foundation Models, Stanford Data Science, and CSLI. We include members of the Linguistics Department, the Computer Science Department, the Psychology Department, and the Graduate School of Education, among others. Want to work with us?
