Baby’s first bath, a 3 a.m. fever and technicolor spit-up can elicit a range of emotions from first-time mothers—and just as many questions. An AI-based chatbot in development by University of Maryland researchers is working...read more These Researchers Want to Read Your Mind New UMD study seeks to decipher ‘imagined speech’ in the brain. “Tell me what you’re really thinking” rarely gets a straightforward response, even from the most candid individual. But for those trying to reach someone who’s unable to communicate, even a hint would be welcome as...read more UMD Researchers Caution Against Allowing Robots to Run on AI Models They urge robot manufacturers to conduct additional safety research before integrating language and vision models into their hardware. Computer scientists at the University of Maryland have asked robot makers to do further safety research before wiring language and vision models to their hardware. Given the constant stream of reports about error-prone, biased, opaque...read more Break Through Tech DC at UMD Hosts Career Launch Expo Students displayed innovative tech projects and cultivated professional skills in a collaborative, industry-supported setting. Break Through Tech DC at UMD held its second Career Launch Expo on January 23, 2024, at the Brendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Engineering .

As a Volpi-Cupal Professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, Hal Daumé III thinks a lot about how machines learn language. He also thinks a lot about trust: he leads the Institute for...read more Can’t Stand Gossip? New Research Suggests That Gabbing About Others Is ‘Not Always a Bad Thing’ Gossiping offers unexpected benefits beyond idle chitchat, according to a study conducted by UMD and Stanford researchers. Rumormongers, blabbermouths, busybodies—no matter what you call them, gossipers get a bad rap. But new theoretical research conducted by University of Maryland and Stanford University researchers argues that gossipers aren’t all that bad. In fact,...read more The Future of AI Education and the Tech Incubator Program Capital One created a campus Tech Incubator at UMD, where students worked on emerging AI and ML capabilities that will transform the financial services industry. The rapidly changing landscape of artificial intelligence and machine learning requires us to think differently about how we prepare students to advance in this evolving field. Capital One created a campus Tech Incubator at the...read more Browse All News RSS Feed Are you an alum with news to share? We want to hear about it! Upcoming Events Dept.
