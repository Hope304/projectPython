Remarkably, he still continues to deliver on-point revisions - as this second volume in his ongoing 'Reworks' EP series proves. There's much to admire across the six tracks on show, from the atmospheric, slow-burn excellence of AOR disco revision 'Stars In The Ghetto' and the dub-funk wonder that is the James Brown-sampling 'Boss', to the peak-time '80s disco sing-along 'Take Time' and the on-point Clash dub disco revision 'Magnificent'. We also recommend 'Be With You', a deliciously groovy, dubbed-out take on a Doc Severinsen track that has long been a DJ Harvey favourite....Read moreSteve Bug / CleIt Just Happened EPNu GrooveSteve Bug and Cle, two titans of electronic music, reunite once again to deliver a mesmerizing EP titled "It Just Happened" on the illustrious Nu Groove Records.

Lead cut "City Lights" kicks off with some deep and melancholic bassline house next to some moody techno reminiscent of early Ben Klock in "10247". "The Clap" delivers some footwork inspirations next to some spookier electro wares in "Neophile" - banging. "Pisecean" gets all breakbeat and new age in the mix alongside some warehouse techno in "Regular Disturbances" alongside some melodic 'Mathew Johnson' inspired sounds in "Old Paris". Closing out the EP is "What" - a British Murder Boys-esque slice of Middle Eastern themed gothic EBM....Read moreLen FakiFusion Remixes 01/03FigureLen Faki's "Fusion Remixes 01/03" on Figure delves into the acclaimed album "Fusion," reimagining its diverse tracks through the lens of renowned techno artists. This release presents a fascinating exploration, showcasing contrasting interpretations and highlighting the versatility of Faki's original work. While remaining rooted in techno, the remixes delve into various subgenres, showcasing the versatility of the original tracks and the talent of the remixers.

Each remixer brings their own magic. rRoxymore's "Tor 8" remix pulsates with dark energy, while Djrum's "Don't Be Stupid Day" is a distorted, raw dancefloor weapon.
