GISAID - gisaid.org In Focus Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2024-2025 Northern Hemisphere Influenza Season announced (Montreux) An advisory group of experts taking part in a meeting organized by the WHO Global Influenza Programme between 19-22 February 2024 analyzed influenza virus surveillance data generated by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and issued on 23 February 2024, recommendations on the composition of the influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. These recommendations are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce and license influenza vaccines. read more:16 million hCoV-19 sequences shared: Where do surveillance efforts stand? After mixed efforts in 2020, followed by a massive explosion of Omicron data generated by late 2021 from 215 countries and territories, the number of unique submitting countries, and hence, representativeness of global surveillance, today remains at early 2021 levels, and well above 2020 levels. While the US, UK, and Germany contributed an outsized share in 2022, it is worth pointing out that increasing representation of diverse regions over time, and the timeliness of submissions are far more critical to ensure new variants are detected in real-time. The recent timely discovery of BA.2.86 and EG.5.1 are examples of continued effectiveness so far.Photo credit: Dunnock_DH5N1 continues to impact global bird populations A clade of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, originating from poultry but subsequently identified in migratory birds, is severely impacting wild bird populations, including endangered bird species. Over 100 million birds have been killed across the globe, making this the largest outbreak in poultry in history. The current H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b is also affecting South America where several countries have recorded their first ever cases. Events with mammal-to-mammal transmission have been reported, including in farmed mink and in marine mammals. Although HPAI H5N1 can cause serious disease in humans, no known human-to-human spread has been identified. GISAID is closely working with its partners to help facilitate the timely sharing of the latest genomic data. > for more, see statements by WHO Global Influenza Programme and WOAH GISAID joins the G20 Joint Finance & Health Ministerial Meeting Yogyakarta, 20-21 June. Under the motto ‘Strengthening Global Health Architecture’ a delegation from GISAID attended the G20 Finance and Health Ministers meeting hosted by Indonesia, to discuss with G20 Member States’ and its partners their vision for GISAID+ (GISAID plus). Global leaders reflected on the need to coordinate and strengthen resources during future pandemics. In particular Member States stressed the essential role GISAID plays in global health security, and discussed how global leaders could support GISAID’s expansion as a global resource to respond to other priority pathogens with major impact and pandemic-potential. > read moreCBD Study finds 'GISAID might provide useful lessons and insight to ABS discussions' A peer-reviewed fact-finding and scoping study on digital sequence information on genetic resources in the context of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol, highlights key advantages of GISAID’s sharing mechanism and a fair and equitable benefit-sharing resulting from access to data.

As one of the key players in ensuring effective data sharing GISAID has made a significant contribution to global health security Prof. Jane Halton AO PSM Chair, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations CEPICommemorating the centenary of the 1918 pandemic, the most catastrophic event in the recorded history of influenza, it is reassuring to know that GISAID is ready and prepared when a similar event emerges and threatens global health. Congratulations on bringing together one of the most successful global collaborations ever achieved Prof. Dr Rob Webster St Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TennesseeThe unique contribution of the GISAID data sharing mechanism is the confidence it has engendered among scientific and political communities as it has added to their capabilities to collaborate more effectively to combat influenza viruses Dr med David NabarroUnited Nations System Coordinat.for Avian & Human Influenza (ret)We do need substantially innovative mechanisms for microbe sharing, if mankind is to survive future pandemics. GISAID is an excellent example!!!

CueniDirector GeneralInternational Federation of PharmaManufacturers & AssociationsThe tenth anniversary of GISAID represents a landmark in global solidarity. A pandemic strain of influenza is perhaps the world's greatest threat. Everything GISAID stands for: virus sharing, cutting-edge research, open access, and international cooperation to guarantee health security couldn't be more important Prof. Lawrence O. GostinWHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health LawGeorgetown UniversityGISAID’s trustworthy data sharing principles forever transformed global collaboration in the fight against influenza, enabling unprecedented rapid response to outbreaks. In 2013, Nature called China’s sharing of H7N9 avian influenza data through GISAID ‘next to exemplary’ Prof. Dr George Fu GaoDirector GeneralChinese Center for Disease Control and PreventionThe core principles enshrined in GISAID's sharing mechanism are a shining beacon of hope.
