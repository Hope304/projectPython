As we transition, you may not see some of the collections you were once able to submit to in DataSpace, and that means Princeton Data Commons is ready for you. If you are intending to publish from the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and you have questions about the new submission process, please contact publications@pppl.gov. For all other questions about getting started with submissions to Princeton Data Commons, please contact prds@princeton.edu. For more information, please visit the Princeton Research Data Service website.DataSpace is a digital repository meant for both archiving and publicly disseminating digital data which are the result of research, academic, or administrative work performed by members of the Princeton University community. DataSpace will promote awareness of the data and address concerns for ensuring the long-term availability of data in the repository.
