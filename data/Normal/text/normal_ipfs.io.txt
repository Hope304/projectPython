Our peer-to-peer content delivery network is built around the innovation of content addressing: store, retrieve, and locate data based on the fingerprint of its actual content rather than its name or location. Open The IPFS network is distributed and participatory, which reduces the problem of data silos that plague central servers. Verifiable The integrity of all data is verified using hash functions, so you can trust that you always get the data you’re looking for. Resilient Files and data can be stored across multiple nodes, which keeps content at the ready even during critical outages. Learn how it works Get Started Join thousands of developers who choose IPFS to build software that’s open, verifiable, and resilient. Build peer-to-peer apps with IPFS Our most popular implementations are written in Go, Rust, and JavaScript – and we also have support for desktop, browsers, mobile, embedded devices, and more. DevelopersDocumentationRead Case Studies Store and manage your data on IPFS Use content addressing to give your data unique identifiers, and use IPFS for large-scale data storage and compute. Publish with IPFSRetrieve CIDs with IPFS Use IPFS apps Share files, stream music, publish your website, store NFTs, and much more through hundreds of applications built on IPFS.

The plethora of IPFS documentation and community members contributes toward our goal at Agregore of making peer-to-peer web apps easy to use.” Mauve Signweaver, Founder - Agregore “It's crucially important to have a distributed file system in our open hypertext system. IPFS is the missing piece that allows for a truly decentralized and open web.” Gabo H Beaumont, Co-Founder - Mintter inc “As people learn about IPFS, they also get a view of IPFS as a component in a broader ecosystem. It's not an island. It's not a technology that lives entirely on its own, it's a piece of a broader stack of something. We see it as an onramp to broader decentralization.” Wes Floyd, Bacalhau “I use NFT.storage for my digital art. It was such a relief to know that I could store my videos in one place—each one with its own IPFS URL and CID. Resilience is important to me and having the work backed up to Filecoin means they'll be around for a long time.” Nancy Baker Cahill, Artist “At 3box labs, we are using IPFS as the storage layer. If you want to build full decentralized applications, you need data integrity. IPFS guarantees integrity by providing a framework for merkelized data.” Joel Thorstenssen, Co-founder - 3Box Labs “IPFS and content addressing give us the opportunity to work towards having every human be able to put data online effectively for free, and effectively forever.” Boris Mann, Co-founder - Fission “At Cloudflare, we offer to make content available to every user of the Internet. By removing lock-in to any single data storage provider, IPFS really allows our customers to choose a storage provider they are comfortable with.” Thibault Meunier, Research Engineer - Cloudflare “By using IPFS private swarms, we were able to deploy a fleet of devices communicating mission critical data in a factory without any central infrastructure, which has allowed us to move much faster.” Roland Kuhn, Actyx “IPFS gives us a set of flexible building blocks for connecting devices and exchanging data.
