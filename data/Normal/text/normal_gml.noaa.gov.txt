Research Themes Greenhouse Gases and Carbon Cycle Feedbacks Changes in Surface Radiation, Clouds, and Aerosols Recovery of Stratospheric Ozone Programs Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Measurments and modeling of the spatial and temporal distributions of greenhouse gases, providing constraints to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Halocarbons and other Trace Species Quantifying the distributions and magnitudes of the sources and sinks for important ozone-depleting and greenhouse gases. Global Radiation and Aerosols Empirical and theoretical research of the Earth's surface radiation budget and characterizing variability and trends of climate-forcing properties of aerosol particles. Ozone and Water Vapor Research on the nature and causes of the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer and the role of ozone and water vapor in forcing climate change.
