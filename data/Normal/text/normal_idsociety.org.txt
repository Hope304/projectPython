Over 95% of Americans have some degree of immunity either from prior infection, vaccination or both. IDSA Response to CDC’S Spring 2024 COVID Vaccine Recommendation Infectious diseases experts strongly encourage an additional COVID-19 vaccine in spring 2024 for people 65 years of age and older as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Update Alert: Serologic Testing IDSA has released Version 2.0 of the Diagnosis of COVID-19: Serologic Testing guidelines. Key recommendations advise against early serologic testing, discourage routine testing for those previously infected or vaccinated, and suggest specific antibody tests three to five weeks after symptom onset. This update is endorsed by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Society for Microbiology.
