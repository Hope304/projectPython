See more News & Social MEDIUM ARTICLE: Reflecting with AI: A Tool to Develop Human Intelligence @stanforddschool From Charlotte Burgess Auburn, Director of Community at the d.school: Every year around this time, we take the opportunity to exercise our hands-on design and making skills with some creative gingerbread confections. Sometimes architectural, sometimes more metaphorical in our builds, this year we wanted to go full-on celebratory. We focused our deliciously sweet constructions on honoring our beloved Professor Bernard Roth, so we crafted the "Journeys of Bernie.‚Äù Bernie is going emeritus this January after 60+ years teaching at Stanford in the Mechanical Engineering Department‚Äîand for 20 of those years collaborating with us the d.school! Showcased here are some pictures of our creations: Bernie with his beloved bike, a gingerbread bus representing Bernie's time on the playa, a beautiful depiction of the serene path he frequently walks on right behind his home... There's even one scene representing the power of the word "AND." Bernie shares that "AND speaks to one of the primary skills of design thinking and in life: being comfortable with ambiguity. AND opens one's life to possibilities that do not exist if one is firmly entrenched on only side of the room... With AND you are free to learn and grow in all directions." AND we'd be remiss if we didn't shine a light on what an extraordinary person Bernie is. üåü - A pioneer in the fields of Kinematics and Robotics üåü - A teacher of design and design-thinking, a founder and defender of the d.school üåü - A Burning Man enthusiast üåü - A mentor, advisor, and friend to many As David Kelley put it simply, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never met anyone that doesn‚Äôt love Bernie.‚Äù We certainly do. Thank you for everything Bernie! 04 Happening Now Upcoming Events View Event Mar. 29, 2024 Introductory Design Thinking Workshop for Working Professionals Are you a working professional?
