Trump, who has repeatedly vowed not to "give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate," repeated his call during an appearance in Richmond on Saturday, according to former Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va. "Trump said in Richmond, that he will take all federal funds away from public schools that require vaccines," she tweeted. "Like most states, Virginia requires MMR vaccine, chickenpox vaccine, polio, etc. So Trump would take millions in federal funds away from all Virginia public schools." BumRushDaShow Biden administration finalizes rule cutting credit card late fees (ABC News) The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule Tuesday that will cut the typical credit card late fee to $8 from $32. The financial regulator estimates the move will save American families $10 billion every year -- an average savings of $220 annually for more than 45 million people who are charged late fees when they don't pay their statements by the due date. applegrove Biden Looks to Taunt Trump (Political Wire) “President Biden is privately pushing for a much more aggressive approach to 2024: Go for Donald Trump’s jugular,” Axios reports. “Biden is convinced he’ll rattle Trump if he taunts him daily.” “Biden has told friends he thinks Trump is wobbly, both intellectually and emotionally, and will explode if Biden mercilessly gigs and goads him — ‘go haywire in public,’ as one adviser put it.” “Other sources tell us that Biden is looking for a fight.” KS Toronado Tuesday TOONs PCIntern Please allow me a suggestion The phrase “Rapid Downhill Course” should be utilized when discussing Creamsicle’s mental and physical status. I am absolutely seeing that in the Orange Menace, and this is occurring on several axes simultaneously. His facial appearance has manifestly altered in recent weeks, his judgement and thus his attention to his accoutrements including his hair has obviously dwindled, his speech patterns are clearly pathological and associated I believe with small cerebrovascular accidents, a.k.a. “small strokes” which would account for his worsening gait - dragging his leg behind him - and his trailing off and staring into space while he marshals his “thoughts”. marmar There is something wrong at the New York Times (Salon) Two things... check that... three things appear to have gone off the rails at the paper we used to call the Gray Lady. First, whoever is in charge of the paper’s polls is not doing their job. Second, whoever is choosing what to emphasize in the Times coverage of the campaign for the presidency is showing bias. Third, the Times is obsessed with Joe Biden’s age at the same time they’re leaving evidence of Donald Trump’s mental and verbal stumbles completely out of the news. babylonsister It's Nuts That Trump Will Soon Have Classified National Security Intelligence Briefings Again (Daily Beast) Trump was irresponsible with government secrets while he was in office. He was irresponsible with government secrets after he left office. And Trump is now under immense financial pressure to sell information that he possesses in order to cover his debts. When Trump becomes the Republican nominee for president, he’ll be entitled once again to receive national security briefings. In a normal world, this wouldn’t happen. No responsible party would nominate for president a person who had disclosed classified information in the past, is under credible suspicion of having stolen and concealed classified information in the present, and who is under immense pressure to sell classified information in the future. But here we are. ItsjustMe New selfie shows key figure in fake electors plot posing with Alex Jones at January 6th Capitol riot Yo_Mama_Been_Loggin Democracy is imperiled globally. Republicans are on the wrong side. (Washington Post) The refusal of House Republicans to fund aid for Ukraine, their insistence on pursuing a bogus impeachment scheme hatched by an indicted Russian FBI source in contact with Russian intelligence services and their unfailing loyalty to an anti-democratic demagogue infatuated with Russian President Vladimir Putin will further aggravate the existential threat facing democracy around the globe. MAGA Republicans’ recent conduct will only hasten the dangerous trend toward authoritarianism spelled out in Freedom House’s recent report “Freedom in the World 2024: The Mounting Damage of Flawed Elections and Armed Conflict.” AZLD4Candidate Trump compares migrants to Hannibal Lecter in 'The Silence of the Lambs' (NBC News) Former President Donald Trump compared migrants Monday to the character Hannibal Lecter in the film "The Silence of the Lambs" as he ramped up anti-immigrant rhetoric that has become a mainstay of his campaign remarks. In Monday's interview, Trump further dehumanized migrants by comparing their languages to languages from Mars. "We don’t even have teachers of some of these languages. Who would think that? We have languages that are, like, from, from the planet Mars?" Trump said. "Nobody, nobody knows how to, you know, speak it."
