LAMORI | Neon lit nightmares Skip to main content Social links E-mailFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramSpotify LAMORI Main menuMusicLiveImagesContactMerch Image Slider Page NEON LIT NIGHTMARES Finnish five-piece LAMORI keeps stirring things up in the goth rock camp, as they have for over a decade now. Fusing their nordic goth rock roots with modern metal, electronics, dark wave, and everything in between, they create their own neon-lit flavor of the genre. Hailing from the Aland Islands of Finland, the band formed in 2009. The lineup has remained unchanged. However, their sound continues to evolve with each release. NEON BLOOD FIRE The band's fourth album to be released by Wormholedeath, will refine the soundscapes heard on the 2020 released NEO NOIR, but also introduce completely new elements to the mix. NEON BLOOD FIRE will have some of the heaviest LAMORI songs ever heard! LAMORI ARE Matias - Vocals Marcus - Guitar Mikael - Bass Jens - Keys Emanuel - Drums.
