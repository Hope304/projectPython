When speaking on her latest album, Jayden Nicole Binnix shared:This album was created while I was living in Maryland and beginning high school. My family home was secluded and tucked away within the suffocating trees. It was my first major project I had ever worked on and I was only 15. Within this time, the unexpected Pandemic hit. Days blended together, as deep isolation set in. I felt as if I saw the world in 3rd person. Seclusion in my room became my existence.If you’re enjoying the latest single, please consider visiting their website here.

The band shared about the new single, “The moment just before the storm hits. Built up, frenetic energy that exists in your mind, with the knowledge that it can surely come spilling out at any point. Pretending to have internal peace gets exhausting after a while.” If you’re enjoying the latest track, you can pre-order their new EP, Crush, here.

This EP, in particular, draws from Middleton’s time as an infantryman in the US Army and tackles some pretty heavy topics ranging from the process of him readjusting to life post-service, the emotional trauma and mental health challenges that he’s faced and has been working to overcome. With a sound that ranges somewhere between the brooding rock of Stabbing Westward paired with the vocals of Post Malone, Luke Middleton’s future looks incredibly bright. Read More “Luke Middleton – nothing ever after”Silverplanes – “Down The Drain” (Video Premiere) Adam Grundy 17 hours ago Today I’m so excited to bring everyone the latest video from space rock trio, Silverplanes, called “Down The Drain.” On this eclectic single from Silverplanes, they channel their love for Alt-Rock hooks in the style of Smashing Pumpkins, paired with the pop sensibilities of Rooney, in a unique way that is sure to leave a mark on the music scene. The band shared:”Down the Drain” is about life passing by so quickly and one day looking back thinking, how did I get here? What happened to all the things we were going to do? Realizing you have changed but you’re still the same deep inside, and finally coming to terms with all the crazy things that have happened and resolving to carry on. The video captures various stages of myself visiting past and future.Silverplanes will be releasing their debut LP, Airbus, on April 5th. I was also able to catch up with this band for a brief interview below.

The O or P visa are commonly used for musicians. They are each limited to specific purposes and not a substitute for a green card. An artist may even have multiple O visas depending on their overall activities in the United States. Both O and P visas can be labor intensive depending on the musical genre, profile of band/artist, nature of the arrangement, and timeline. Like any U.S. visa, there are associated filing fees and attorney fees but, unlike the H-1B work visa, the O or P do not mandate the sponsor/employer pay all legal or government filing fees.And now, touring is getting even more expensive. On April 1, 2024, the new fee schedule from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will take effect. Applications for most work visas and employment-based green cards will now have higher filing fees and require a new mandatory asylum fee ranging from $300 to $600 (non-profits are exempt). This new fee will be used to fund part of the costs of administering our nation’s asylum program and will be paid each and every time an O or P visa is filed (side note that it is possible that the final fee rule will be challenged in court and all or part of the new fee rule may be enjoined).Cassadee Pope on New Podcast Jason Tate 17 hours ago Cassadee Pope is the latest guest on The Wasting Time Podcast.Two Door Cinema Club Announce Tour Jason Tate 17 hours ago Two Door Cinema Club have announced a new tour.
