This site archives his work and career. That career began with a focus on constitutional and comparative constitutional law. Beginning in the mid-1990s, his focus shifted to the Internet and intellectual property. Since 2007, his focus has been on institutional corruption, and the fight to establish a representative democracy in America. That project was meant to take 10 years. It has taken a bit longer.
