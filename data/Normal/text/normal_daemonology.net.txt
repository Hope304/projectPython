daemonology.net I started out using this domain strictly for my BSD-related activities, but it is turning into a dumping ground for all sorts of personal work. I've got a variety of work here: The FreeBSD-on-EC2 status page. My FreeBSD Update utility. An advisory about a security flaw in Intel Hyper-Threading. A short set of instructions on how to upgrade a FreeBSD 4.8 system to FreeBSD 4.11. ... instructions to upgrade a FreeBSD 5.3 system to FreeBSD 5.4. ... instructions to upgrade a FreeBSD 5.4 system to FreeBSD 6.0. ... and a script to to upgrade a FreeBSD 6.0 system to FreeBSD 6.1. A tool for securely updating the FreeBSD ports tree. An extremely minimalist pipelined HTTP client which I wrote in order to speed up portsnap. My binary diff tool. A port of NetBSD's makefs utility. My depenguinator. An Enhanced Speedstep driver for FreeBSD. A list of work I've published and/or had cited by other authors. Hacker News Daily, a summary of top-ranked articles from Hacker News. Ask Hacker News Weekly, a summary of top-ranked "Ask HN" (aka. "self post") articles from Hacker News. My quasi-blog, Daemonic Dispatches. Not on this site, but still likely to be of interest, is my Tarsnap online backup service.
