Under the GDPR, the intent of the GPC signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (GDPR Articles 7 & 21). Over time, the GPC signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.“CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.”Xavier BecerraCA Attorney General“40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.”Roy WydenSenate Finance Chairman“My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.”Mark R. WarnerVA Senator“GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.”Alexander McD WhiteBermuda Privacy Commissioner“It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.”Ron WydenSenate Finance Chairman“CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.”Xavier BecerraCA Attorney GeneralGot to slide 0Got to slide 1Got to slide 2Got to slide 3Got to slide 4Got to slide 5Join over 50 million users.Download a supported browser or extension and start exercising your privacy rights with GPC.

It consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the specification. Who is supporting the development of GPC?GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders: technologists, web publishers, technology companies, browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and civil rights organizations. The GPC was initially spearheaded by Ashkan Soltani Georgetown Law and Sebastian Zimmeck (Wesleyan University) in collaboration with The New York Times, The Washington Post, Financial Times, Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr), Glitch, DuckDuckGo, Brave, Mozilla, Disconnect, Abine, Digital Content Next (DCN), Consumer Reports, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). I’m a web user. How can I use GPC to signal my privacy preferences to websites?GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions, listed here.
