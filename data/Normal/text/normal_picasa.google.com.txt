Moving on from Picasa Moving on from Picasa We’ve decided to retire Picasa in order to focus on a single photo service in Google Photos – a new, smarter photo app that works seamlessly across mobile and the web. Where can I find my photos? If you have photos or videos in a Picasa Web Album, the easiest way to still access, modify and share most of that content is to log in to Google Photos. Your photos and videos will already be there. Go to Google Photos Can I still use the desktop application? For those who have already downloaded it, it will continue to work as it does today. But we will not be developing it further, and there will be no future updates.If you choose to switch to Google Photos, you can continue to upload photos and videos using the desktop uploader at photos.google.com/apps.

Please visit the Picasa Product Forum. What if I’m a developer? We will be retiring some functions of the Picasa API. Developers can learn more here. Moving forward We apologize for any inconvenience this transition causes, but we want to assure you that we’re doing this with the aim of providing the best photos experience possible. Google Photos is a new and smarter product that offers a better platform for us to build amazing experiences and features for you in the future.
