Our Mission ProDataLabs is a data providing company based in California with the mission of making customer database reliable. Providing you with top quality services in affordable prices is our main aim, as we only want to see you grow and thrive. Frequently Asked Questions Are your mailing lists authentic? Yes, we offer authentic datasets to our customers. We ensure that our lists are up-to-date and error-free. How accurate are your mailing lists? Our Email lists are 95% accurate. You may also ask why our lists aren’t 100% correct. The answer to it is that no company can offer 100% accurate information as data is a volatile product that keeps changing with time. Assurance of providing 100% accurate data, is a trap. Do not fall for it and ensure that you make a smart choice. What are the formats in which the datasets will be delivered? We deliver data in easily downloadable formats like .csv and .xls. Files in these formats can easily be opened in Microsoft Excel, WordPad, Notepad and OpenOffice. What is the timeframe for order delivery? You will receive a download link as soon as you place the order from our website. You can check your spam/junk folder if you don’t receive the link within a few minutes. If you still don’t find the link, you can immediately contact us. And we assure you that our data provider will respond to you as soon as possible. What are the payment options that your company offers? We accept payments only through PayPal. What type of support facilities do you offer? You can contact us any time and we will be at your service. We help you to deal with the data by answering your queries through phone calls, live chat and Email support. Are your Email addresses permission-based? Our data is CAN-SPAM compliant. We collect data from reliable sources, which take legal permission for sharing data to third–party marketers. What is the volume of your data? There are currently over 2,700 million detailed opt-in contact addresses. What about discounts? If I choose to buy more than one mailing list, will I get any discount or special offer? Yes, we provide discounts on bulk orders. What about the refund? Do you have any return policies? We do not have any refund or return policies. We provide accurate, verified and validated data and if you face any problems with regard to the data, you can contact our customer service executive any time.
