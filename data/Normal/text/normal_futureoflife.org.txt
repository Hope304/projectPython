This is why we have made it our mission to ensure that technology continues to improve those prospects.Our missionLearn moreJust launchedTheAutonomous Weapons NewsletterStay up-to-date on the autonomous weapons space with a monthly newsletter covering policymaking efforts, weapons systems technology, and more.Sign up to the newsletter Our missionEnsuring that our technology remains beneficial for lifeOur mission is to steer transformative technologies away from extreme, large-scale risks and towards benefiting life. Read moreHow certain technologies are developed and used has far-reaching consequences for all life on earth.If properly managed, these technologies could change the world in a way that makes life substantially better, both for those alive today and those who will one day be born. They could be used to treat and eradicate diseases, strengthen democratic processes, mitigate - or even halt - climate change and restore biodiversity.If irresponsibly managed, they could inflict serious harms on humanity and other animal species. In the most extreme cases, they could bring about the fragmentation or collapse of societies, and even push us to the brink of extinction.The Future of Life Institute works to reduce the likelihood of these worst-case outcomes, and to help ensure that transformative technologies are used to the benefit of life.Our missionCause areasThe risks we focus onWe are currently concerned by three major risks. They all hinge on the development, use and governance of transformative technologies. We focus our efforts on guiding the impacts of these technologies.Artificial IntelligenceFrom recommender algorithms to chatbots to self-driving cars, AI is changing our lives. As the impact of this technology grows, so will the risks.Artificial IntelligenceBiotechnologyFrom the accidental release of engineered pathogens to the backfiring of a gene-editing experiment, the dangers from biotechnology are too great for us to proceed blindly.BiotechnologyNuclear WeaponsAlmost eighty years after their introduction, the risks posed by nuclear weapons are as high as ever - and new research reveals that the impacts are even worse than previously reckoned.Nuclear Weapons UAV Kargu autonomous drones at the campus of OSTIM Technopark in Ankara, Turkey - June 2020.Our workHow we are addressing these issuesThere are many potential levers of change for steering the development and use of transformative technologies.
