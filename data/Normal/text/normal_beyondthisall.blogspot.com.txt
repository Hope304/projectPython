Awesomeness; Awesomeness; Facebook, Twitter, why not Blogger? I thought i'd give this a try. Pretty much anything im interested in, or trying new things. Ill give it a blog. :) Sunday, February 20, 2011 Home again! Home again :) It was nice to see all my dedicated followers and readers that they were wanting me to return quickly to keep blogging. I can just say, Thailand was amazing. Id reccomend it to anyone. I will post pictures soon :D And for all the mac vs. pc debaters out there, I caved into buying a macbook pro 13" yesterday. Its amazing and i have to say, its exactly what i need for university. Its easy to carry around, its simple (yet so powerful) and great for my essays. I hope to catch up on everyones posts soon!

Mr. Sunshine aired last night on ABC, and already there is mixed comments on how it went.Personally, I felt it was great (Im biased because I think he's one of the better actors around- tied first with Morgan Freeman) The comedy had well written lines and was not begging for laughter. The kind of comedy you would find in Friends or Studio 60. I hope well for him, and hope that it lasts for more than a season! Thoughts? What series are you currently watching? Any suggestions?

If you know your movies, you know that this cottage is the film location for the Harry Potter films. Recently, I have taken upon a university film project and I need to find websites that display Harry Potter pictures of the set. Preferably ones with green and blue screens. The picture above shows theres a lake, so pretty much im comparing the surrounds to the movie. Thankyou in advance :) Oh and I cannot wait for the last installment!
