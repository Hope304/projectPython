Moxie Marlinspike >> About ABOUT (current) LIFE PROJECTS BLOG About This site is a partial collection of projects I've worked on, vignettes I've written down, and software I've published. In the past, I've worked as a founder, engineer, sailor, captain, and shipwright. I used to travel a lot; I've hopped freight trains across the US from coast-to-coast a bunch of times, have gotten some really great and some really terrible rides hitchhiking all across America, and have sailed a few near-derelict sailboats as far as I could take them. I currently live in California. In general, I hope to contribute to a world where we value skills and relationships over careers and money, where we know better than to trust cops or politicians, and where we're passionate about building and creating things in a self-motivated and self-directed way.
