[Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]“The occupation army targeted the safe homes of citizens with direct bombardment from military jets. It also bombed a mosque in the same area, which led to the killing of many people,” the office said. [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]“We hold the Israeli occupation fully responsible for this heinous massacre and the ongoing massacres against our Palestinian people. We also blame the international community and American administration and President Biden personally for the continuation of massacres and crimes in violation of international law and all international treaties and conventions,” the media office said.

[Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]Every hour in Gaza 15 people are killed - six are children.
