IDX Advisors Chief Investment Officer Ben McMillan sits down with Yahoo Finance to talk about the stance Biden and Trump administrations may have on cryptocurrencies, as well as discussing the exposure spot bitcoin ETF offerings are giving to investors, particularly in their 401(k) plans. "It was difficult to hold it in something like an IRA or a 401(k) plan. Now this is part of the mainstreaming of crypto. Now, this time is different — we can't just throw caution to the winds as it relates to the macro regime," McMillan says.

In a new report Tuesday, the organization said Canada lags behind nearly half of its OECD peers in its share of female managers.

The company will be added to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on March 18. Wedbush Securities SVP of Equity Research Matt Bryson joins Yahoo Finance to talk about Super Micro Computer's run and its mounting challenges as the company scales and faces competition in the sector. While Bryson claims Super Micro has excelled in its efforts to rebrand itself as the leading provider of AI services, he questions whether AI can continue to grow at the present levels. Lofty targets are now priced into Wall Street's valuation, but Bryson says this doesn't present "a ton of risk" in the near term. He notes that in Q4 "it wasn't just Super Micro that was exceeding estimates in AI.

Backlog was still growing through Q4 even with sales lifting. So I think in the near term there's still strong demand...In my mind it's more a question of what happens back half of '24 and into '25.
