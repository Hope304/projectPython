Home FOR EVERY CHALLENGE, THERE HAS TO BE A SOLUTION For millions of smallholder farmers, simply growing enough food to eat is a challenge. Getting enough water to grow your crops is hard when it only rains once a year and temperatures reach 30 degrees most of the year. Offering farmers across Africa and India solutions to managing water is at the heart of this project. Through independent research, the project team has identified workable solutions to the problems faced by individual farmers. Whether you are involved in development work or represent a corporate enterprise, take a look at what the AgWater Solutions project has discovered and see if you could be part of a solution.
