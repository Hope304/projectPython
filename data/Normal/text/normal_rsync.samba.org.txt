The 3.0.0 version number is such a large bump up from 2.6.9 due to the addition of an incremental recursion scan (which helps a lot with large transfers) and the official arrival of several other new features, including ACL support, extended attribute support, filename character-set conversion, etc. See the 3.0.0 NEWS for a detailed changelog. Rsync version 2.6.9 released November 6th, 2006 Rsync version 2.6.9 has been released. This is primarily a bug-fix release with a few minor new features. See the 2.6.9 NEWS for a detailed changelog. Rsync version 2.6.8 released April 22th, 2006 Rsync version 2.6.8 has been released. This is a bug-fix release that primarily addresses an exclude problem that affected the --relative option, but also includes a security fix for the xattrs.diff patch (which is not an official part of rsync, but some packagers include it in their release). See the 2.6.8 NEWS for a detailed changelog. Rsync 2.6.7 released March 11th, 2006 Rsync version 2.6.7 has been released.

This release is a bug-fix release which contains a security fix to handle a null-pointer bug that turned up in rsync's version of zlib 1.1.4 (this is not the recent zlib 1.2.2 security fix, which did not affect rsync) and to squash a few other minor bugs. To deal with the zlib issue, rsync has been upgraded to include zlib 1.2.3. See the 2.6.6 NEWS for a detailed changelog. Rsync 2.6.5 released June 1st, 2005 Rsync version 2.6.5 has been released.

Rsync 2.6.3 released September 30th, 2004 Rsync version 2.6.3 has been released. It contains several new features and quite a few bug fixes, including a security fix for a patch-sanitizing bug in the daemon code. See the 2.6.3 NEWS for a detailed changelog. Rsync 2.6.2 released April 30th, 2004 Rsync version 2.6.2 has been released. It is a bug-fix release that mainly fixes a bug with the --relative option (-R) in 2.6.1 that could cause files to be transferred incorrectly. This only affected a source right at the root of the filesystem, such as "/" or "/*" (if you first "cd /" and then copy from ".", it would not tickle the bug). See the 2.6.2 NEWS for a detailed changelog. Rsync 2.6.1 released April 26th, 2004 Rsync version 2.6.1 has been released. It is primarily a performance release that requires less memory to run, makes fewer write calls to the socket (lowering the system CPU time), does less string copying (lowering the user CPU time), and also reduces the amount of data that is transmitted over the wire. There have also been quite a few bug fixes, including a security fix for a daemon problem when chroot is not enabled. See the 2.6.1 NEWS for a detailed changelog. One Cygwin hang-problem resolved The problem with rsync hanging at the end of the transfer on Cygwin had been previously traced to a signal-handling bug in their compatibility DLL. This bug appears to now be fixed in DLL version 1.5.7-1, and Cygwin users are reporting that upgrading the DLL removes the hang-at-end-of-transfer problem for their existing rsync executable. (Note that this doesn't solve a hang that some folks see in the middle of a transfer -- using daemon mode instead of ssh can work around that one.) Rsync 2.6.0 released January 1st, 2004 Two important things to note in the new release: The default remote shell is now "ssh" unless you tell configure you want to make something else the default. Some bug fixes in the include/exclude code, while making things work properly, have resulted in some user-visible changes for certain wildcard strings. Read the BUG FIXES section in the 2.6.0 NEWS to see if any of these changes apply to you. (Most people should be unaffected.) One other item of note is that the oft-requested option "--files-from" is now available. This option lets you specify a list of files to transfer, and can be much more efficient than a recursive descent using include/exclude statements (if you know in advance what files you want to transfer). The list of files can come from either side of the connection, so it is possible for a server to provide the file-list that lets someone grab a server-specified set of files, for example. See the rsync man page for more details. See the 2.6.0 NEWS for a detailed changelog.
