Challenges to SP use include mastering an expected learning curve, less fine instrument movement compared with multiport da Vinci surgery, and ensuring optimal camera length from target anatomy. If these challenges can be overcome, single-port robotic surgery offers the advantage of a single incision for minimally invasive pediatric surgery, both extirpative and reconstructive. We present our experience with an SP robotic nephroureterectomy in a 9-year-old patient.
