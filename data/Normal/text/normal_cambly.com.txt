My English has improved a lot and I am having fun studying it!"Shoji Japan"After using Cambly, I seldom have a situation where I am so nervous that my hands shake when I speak English. I used to be afraid of speaking English, and I was always afraid that I wouldn't speak well enough for others to understand, but now I am much better!"Xinrui Liu China"I have experienced a growth in my confidence as an English-speaker, with a host of idioms now at my disposal.
