What we needed was the ability to measure the Covid response, and Circana’s Monthly Sensitivities gave us the real time view of the consumer response, allowing us to time align to actions over time. We chose Circana for this effort because we have a great existing relationship with them, and the Monthly Sensitivities blends well with what already have in place. Rich Seifrid Manager, Advanced Analytics, Conagra Circana worked with us throughout the process to make sure that they had the problem definition correct, went back and forth with that to make sure that everything was lined up, and then once we did get the results, they were gracious to set up a full walkthrough with me and then also did it with my team later so that we were able to answer any questions.
