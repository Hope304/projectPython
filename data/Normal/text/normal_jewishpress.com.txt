No matter where we are in the world. No matter the time, the country, the generation. We must know that we are not here alone. In Print What Is The Halacha Of Reciting A Blessing On A Public Menorah Rabbi Shmuel M. Butman Even though it is a custom, we recite a bracha on the communal lighting just like we make a bracha for the custom of reciting Hallel on Rosh Chodesh. The Rivosh adds that one does not fulfills his obligation with the menorah lighting in shul but that everyone must light again at home. In Print What We Want Rabbi Reuven Taragin In addition to fulfilling mitzvot, we should want what Hashem wants, value what He values, and even feel what He feels.

The Mishkan As A Microcosm Of The Universe Parsha Avraham Levitt The material world is everything outside of the Mishkan, as the Mishkan is a means for us to pursue transcendence, and for those who have been properly designated to traverse all of these worlds.
