I’m a senior in college and an All-American athlete. It’s the night before a football game. My Dad’s my biggest fan, my greatest ally and together we’re dreaming of me playing pro football. Life feels great. And then, I get an unexpected call from my sister: Lewis, an SUV went over Dad’s car. The bumper smashed through the window and split his head open. He’s in a coma. He might not make it through the night. Growing up in the small town of Delaware, Ohio, I overcame feeling dumb, feeling lonely, and being bullied for being in special needs classes by dedicating myself to becoming the best athlete I could be. By my side the whole way was my dad supporting me, coaching me, and cheering me on… he was my best friend and my greatest coach.

Crucial reading for any young or struggling man.” Mark Manson #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck “Whether you’re a listener of his podcast or this is your first time learning of Lewis, you will be an instant fan. Lewis’ approach to achieving greatness will leave you inspired and ready to take action in all areas of your life!”Jack CanfieldCocreator, Chicken Soup for the Soul® and The Success Principles: How to Get From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be “I met Lewis when he was just starting out broke on his sister’s couch and he hustled his way to creating an amazing life. This book will show you how to do the same for yourself!” Gary Vaynerchuk New York Times Bestselling author of Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook “For everyone who wants to live a great life-one filled with energy, meaning, and purpose-Lewis Howes provides The School of Greatness. It’s a terrific resource with accessible, practical suggestions for transforming our lives.” Gretchen Rubin “The road to mastery requires studying under a master. This book follows the author as he apprentices under more than a dozen great men and women, each a master in their own way.” Robert Greene “Lewis Howes is ridiculously inspirational. In my ideal world, he’d call me every morning and give me a 10-minute personal pep talk. This book is the next best thing. It’ll make you want to hustle, create a vision, and all that other good stuff.” A.J. Jacobs “I never believed that ‘school’ was my strong suit, but the life lessons that Lewis teaches throughout his book make it so easy to understand and apply to your everyday life. You finish this book feeling impacted, grateful, and inspired to learn more!” Julianne Hough “Most of life is not about our circumstances. It’s about how we perceive and react to them. Lewis Howes’s book, The School of Greatness, gives us all new ways of approaching old problems and making every action count for what matters most in life.” Michael Hyatt “This is one of the most important topics today that seemingly no one is talking about: how men can take care of their emotional health in a 21st century that demands it. Crucial reading for any young or struggling man.”Mark Manson “The rigid ideas of culture teaches us about masculinity and femininity make it nearly impossible for real men and women to truly see and love each other. For men who want to free themselves from cultural cages, Howes’s book is a life changer. For women who want to offer the men in their lives permission to be fully human, The Mask of Masculinity is a vital tool. This book has the power to change lives, relationships, and our culture.” Glennon Doyle “Lewis’s raw truth of what it’s like to be raised as a male athlete in today’s world is exactly what we need to hear. I want every football player (and athlete) to read this book so they can understand what’s possible when they take the helmet off.” Steve Weatherford “In his new book, The Mask of Masculinity, Lewis Howes gives us permission to honor our vulnerability so we can create deeper connections and live a better life. There’s nothing sexier than our authentic truth and this book helps us harness it! Lewis transcends gender in this book- it’s just as much for women as it is for men.” Gabby Bernstein “For women, reading this book will help them to understand the men in their lives on a much deeper level and show them ways that they can support the men they love.” Gretchen Rubin “Lewis Howes is going to help a lot of men with this book.” Dr. Drew Pinsky “Lewis blends vulnerability, insight, and profound courage to a conversation so deeply needed in this pivotal time of dismantling a stifling and violent patriarchy. May his integrated voice echo loudly and widely as an invitation to provide more freedom and love within masculinity.” Alanis Morissette Your Greatness Library JOIN 500 MILLION+ ON THE JOURNEY TO gREAtNESS Podcast Dream Bigger.
