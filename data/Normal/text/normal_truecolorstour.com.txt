In 2007, True Colors visited 16 cities across North America, using hosting discounts, to celebrate diversity which had sold out crowds dancing in the aisles. The theme of the tour was about eliminating hate, specifically about getting the Matthew Shepard Act passed by the U.S. Senate. Tens of thousands of postcards were sent by our audience members to their respective Senators urging them to pass this important piece of legislation which would include the GLBT community in the definition of a hate crime. The bill passed the Senate later that year.
