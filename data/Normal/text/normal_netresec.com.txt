NETRESEC - Network Forensics and Network Security Monitoring Experts in network security monitoring and network forensics NETRESEC| Products| Training| Resources| Blog| About Netresec NETRESEC Network Forensics and Network Security Monitoring Netresec is an independent software vendor with focus on the network security field. We specialize in software for network forensics and analysis of network traffic. Our most well known product is NetworkMiner, which is available in a professional as well as free open source version. We also develop and maintain other software tools, such as CapLoader (for big pcap files) and RawCap (a lightweight sniffer). We at Netresec additionally maintain a comprehensive list of publicly available pcap files. NetworkMiner NetworkMiner is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) for Windows. NetworkMiner can be used as a passive network sniffer/packet capturing tool in order to detect operating systems, sessions, hostnames, open ports etc. without putting any traffic on the network. NetworkMiner can also parse PCAP files for off-line analysis and to regenerate/reassemble transmitted files and certificates from PCAP files. CapLoader CapLoader is a Windows tool designed to handle large amounts of captured network traffic in the tcpdump/libpcap format (PCAP). CapLoader displays the contents of opened PCAP files as a list of TCP and UDP flows. Users can select the flows of interest and quickly filter out those packets from the loaded PCAP files. Sending the selected flows/packets to a packet analyzer tool like Wireshark or NetworkMiner is then just a mouse click away. PolarProxy PolarProxy is a transparent TLS and SSL inspection proxy created for incident responders, malware analysts and security researchers. PolarProxy is primarily designed to intercept and decrypt TLS encrypted traffic from malware that is run in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox. PolarProxy decrypts and re-encrypts TLS traffic, while also saving the decrypted traffic in a PCAP file. Additional software from Netresec can be found on our products page. Headlines from our Blog Hunting for Cobalt Strike in PCAP In this video I analyze a pcap file with network traffic from Cobalt Strike Beacon using CapLoader. The pcap file and Cobalt Strike malware config can be downloaded from Recorded Future&#39;s Triage sandbox. Cobalt Strike Beacon configs can also be extracted locally with help of Didier Stevens&#39; 1768.py[...] Network Forensics Training - Spring 2024 I will teach two live online network forensics classes in March, one on European morning time, and the other on US morning time. The subject for both classes is network forensics in an incident response context. The training is split into four interactive morning sessions, so that you have the after[...] CapLoader 1.9.6 Released CapLoader now detects even more malicious protocols and includes several new features such as JA4 fingerprints, API support for sharing IOCs to ThreatFox and OSINT lookups of malware families on Malpedia. The new CapLoader 1.9.6 release also comes with several improvements of the user interface, for[...] Forensic Timeline of an IcedID Infection The BackConnect and VNC parsers that were added to NetworkMiner 2.8.1 provide a unique possibility to trace the steps of an attacker with help of captured network traffic from a hacked computer. In this blog post I use the free and open source version of NetworkMiner to see how GzipLoader downloads[...] NetworkMiner 2.8.1 Released I am happy to announce the release of NetworkMiner 2.8.1 today! This new release brings a VNC parser to NetworkMiner, so that screenshots, keystrokes and clipboard data can be extracted from unencrypted VNC traffic. NetworkMiner 2.8.1 additionally includes parsers for command-and-control (C2) protoc[...] ùôΩùô¥ùöÉùöÅùô¥ùöÇùô¥ùô≤ | Contact Us | Privacy | X | Mastodon | RSS | News Feed
