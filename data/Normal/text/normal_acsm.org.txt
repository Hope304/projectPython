ACSM Supports Funding for National Concussion Surveillance System and Physical Activity Alliance Releases New Report Last month, ACSM joined more than 30 other organizations in signing a letter requesting at least $2 million to fund the National Concussion Surveillance System. The funding would allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop an initial system that will collect necessary data to determine the incidence of sports-related concussions. This letter will go to House and Senate leadership and both the House and Senate Chairs and Ranking Members of the Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee. The Physical Activity Alliance (PAA), of which ACSM is a founding member, just released a new report: “Advancing Key Actions to Enhance Physical Activity Surveillance in the United States.” The report summarizes actions taken to advance surveillance in four areas: children and youth, workplace, health care and community support for physical activity. It also lays out steps to advance tracking physical activity engagement as a key public health priority and underscores the benefits of systematic data collection to drive policy and programming that supports equitable physical activity opportunities across the U.S. Read the report. Team Physicians Update Guidance on Musculoskeletal Injuries A group of delegates from ACSM, the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine and the American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine recently met to write updated guidelines on the care and treatment of select musculoskeletal injuries as part of the annual Team Physician Consensus Conference (TPCC). The TPCC Executive Committee, consisting of ACSM Fellows Stan Herring, M.D.; Ben Kibler, M.D.; and Margot Putukian, M.D., along with delegates from the partner organizations, reviewed the current scientific literature and clinical evidence to write the new evidence-based statement for clinicians. The resulting document, which will be published in 2022, will provide guidance and serve as a teaching tool for physicians, residents and fellows working in the sports medicine field. Learn More About TPCC The Female Athlete Triad MYTH: It's "normal" for female athletes to lose their period, or stop menstruating. REALITY: Amenorrhea due to working out is unhealthy. Mary Jane De Souza, Ph.D., FACSM, and Nancy Williams, Sc.D., FACSM, both researchers and professors at Pennsylvania State University, have spent many years studying the Female Athlete Triad.
