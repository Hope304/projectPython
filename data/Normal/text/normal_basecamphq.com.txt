Need to watch stuff move through stages? Basecamp’s Card Table is what you need. It’s our unique take on kanban. Watch “How Basecamp Works” Overseeing multiple projects? You could open each one to check its status. But there’s a better way to get the big picture view — it’s called Mission Control. Leave the grind behind. Glide through projects instead. It’s a struggle to juggle people, projects, clients, deadlines, and expectations — especially when you’re the underdog competing against larger companies. We’re like you, we get it. That’s why we built Basecamp. In Basecamp, each project lives on a single page. With everything in reach, and every piece of information tracked and organized, everyone knows where to find what they need, and say what they need to say. Here’s what a project looks like: See how a project starts See a project in progress Hide Notes Not everything under the sun, just the stuff to get things done. Besides unlimited projects, you’ll get pings for private conversations, reports to summarize the essentials, notification protections so you aren’t constantly distracted, a timeline showing you everything that’s happening, exceptional customer service, and plenty more to round it out. Basecamp also helps you consolidate billing, cut costs, and simplify onboarding. When you use Basecamp you don’t need separate apps for chat, file sharing, tasks, or basic scheduling. No more bouncing around, losing stuff, wondering where someone put something, paying multiple bills or onboarding people in multiple places. Less isn’t more, it’s better. We shot an entire TV commercial with just two meetings — here’s how we planned and managed the whole thing in Basecamp. Watch “Made in Basecamp” With real-time Chat built into every Basecamp project, you can ditch whatever separate chat app you’re using (and save money, too). Basecamp’s Lineup shows you where every project stands, from start to finish, all at once, on a single timeline. So clear. A well-run company is part of the package, too. Running a sane, sustainable business is part of our commitment to you. We’ve written bestselling books about our straightforward approach, and our employee handbook is public for everyone to see. 24 profitable, financially responsible years in business.

Watch how a team of two organized and managed a company offsite for 80 people — all within Basecamp! To-dos are straightforward, simple, and clear. Make lists, add items, delegate, discuss, and stay in the loop as work gets done (or know when it doesn’t). Use a few other products too? No problem — Doors let you link up other services you use right alongside Basecamp’s tools. Schedule events, deadlines, and milestones so no one misses anything.

It’s beautiful software that has resisted every wrong trend and stayed true to the things that mattered most. Highly recommended.” —Tobi Lütke, CEO, Shopify Hilary Fitzgerald Campbell, a cartoonist for The New Yorker, used to keep her client notes, doodles, ideas, and invoicing scribbled on post-its, napkins, a pile of sketchbooks, emails and texts. Then she discovered Basecamp. Instead of blasting emails across your organization, post messages on a centralized Message Board instead. Keep conversations centralized, organised, and accessible. Meetings have more than tripled in the past couple years. Still not enough for this guy. Watch “The Chief Meetings Officer” Every project has its own Docs & Files library to organize, share, and store docs, files, and images. Even if they’re in the cloud on other services. Change for the better. We asked our customers “What changed for the better since you switched to Basecamp?” Here’s just some of what they said: “For the first time in a long time our team is truly collaborating, and everyone is moving in the same direction, with the same goals.

Very user friendly.” Kim Curry, Kim Curry Design “We have actually accomplished things that have been waiting forever to get done.” Danek Coffey, Coffey LLC “I’ve tried a million things with clients.

We have everything organized according to clients, projects, employees, etc., resulting in clear and concise communication.” Katie Greathouse, Health Economic Advisors, Inc. “The transparency across departments, and the ability to eliminate bottlenecks in projects that were not previously visible.

Instead of drowning in an endless chain of emails, there is clear, and easy accountability meaning tasks actually get done!” Roxanne Emery, LATE Nation & Gareth Emery “Before Basecamp, I ran my freelance web development business basically from a spreadsheet, then I moved to Basecamp and my life is so much less stressful. Basecamp has increased my happiness exponentially.” Patrick Krebs, Sad Robot Software “I feel like I am better organized and more efficient because of Basecamp. It has also greatly increased our ability to collaborate on projects large or small and have a better idea of the project and all of its pieces, rather than just what I am responsible for.” Alex Jackson, Luther College “I no longer have to wonder whether I’ve asked for something to be done or whether it has in fact been done.
