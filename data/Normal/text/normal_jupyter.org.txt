Project Jupyter | Home Toggle navigation Try Install Get Involved Documentation News Social Governance Security About Free software, open standards, and web services for interactive computing across all programming languages JupyterLab: A Next-Generation Notebook Interface JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality. Try it in your browser Install JupyterLab Jupyter Notebook: The Classic Notebook Interface The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience. Try it in your browser Install the Notebook Language of choice Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala. Share notebooks Notebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer. Interactive output Your code can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types. Big data integration Leverage big data tools, such as Apache Spark, from Python, R, and Scala. Explore that same data with pandas, scikit-learn, ggplot2, and TensorFlow. A multi-user version of the notebook designed for companies, classrooms and research labs Pluggable authentication Manage users and authentication with PAM, OAuth or integrate with your own directory service system. Centralized deployment Deploy the Jupyter Notebook to thousands of users in your organization on centralized infrastructure on- or off-site. Container friendly Use Docker and Kubernetes to scale your deployment, isolate user processes, and simplify software installation. Code meets data Deploy the Notebook next to your data to provide unified software management and data access within your organization. Learn more about JupyterHub Voilà: Share your results Voilà helps communicate insights by transforming notebooks into secure, stand-alone web applications that you can customize and share. Try it in your browser Install Voilà Currently in use at Open Standards for Interactive Computing Project Jupyter promotes open standards that third-party developers can leverage to build customized applications. Think HTML and CSS for interactive computing on the web. Notebook Document Format Jupyter Notebooks are an open document format based on JSON. They contain a complete record of the user's sessions and include code, narrative text, equations, and rich output. Interactive Computing Protocol The Notebook communicates with computational Kernels using the Interactive Computing Protocol, an open network protocol based on JSON data over ZMQ, and WebSockets. The Kernel Kernels are processes that run interactive code in a particular programming language and return output to the user. Kernels also respond to tab completion and introspection requests.
