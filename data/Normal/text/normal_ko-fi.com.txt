What is Ko-fi? Ko-fi is the easiest way for you to start making an income directly from your fans. You can accept donations, create membership tiers, open an online shop, and take commissions all with 0-5% platform fees. Who should use Ko-fi? Artists, Streamers, Podcasters, Writers, Crafters, Photographers, Filmmakers, Cosplayers and all kinds of creators use Ko-fi. How do I get paid? Instantly and directly into your PayPal or Stripe account. We take 0% fees from donations and we don't hold onto your money. It goes directly from your supporter to you. Simple! How much does it cost? Unlike pretty much everyone else, we don't take a cut from your donations! Premium features like Memberships, Ko-fi Shop and Commissions can either be paid for via a small subscription to Ko-fi Gold or a low 5% transaction fee. You decide. Do I have to buy coffee? Not at all! We do love coffee, but it's just a friendly metaphor. So many creators have told us it's just much nicer to ask fans to "buy a coffee" than just "donate" to support your work. You can also change "coffee" to something else, or switch to a traditional donation mode. How much can I earn? Start making an income on Ko-fi regardless of how big your audience is. Thousands of creators make their first money on Ko-fi and some have earned more than $100k in donations alone! I‚Äôm not sure if I should use Ko-fi or Patreon? What‚Äôs the difference? Creators tell us Ko-fi is a simpler, lower pressure alternative to Patreon and you can also do so much more with Ko-fi. Take donations, crowdfund, sell products and offer commission requests all from one place. You keep more of your money on Ko-fi too. We take 0% cut of donations and there are no platform fees at all for Ko-fi Gold creators! Who owns Ko-fi? We're built and owned by creators since 2012. We're not funded by venture capitalists pushing for the next $1b or bust companies. We've passionately grown Ko-fi to 500k creators by focusing on what creators need not what outside funders want. What currencies do you offer? You can take donations or payments in most currencies, but you can save on any currency conversion fees and receive support directly by choosing a base currency of USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, AUD, IRD, YEN or THB. How can I get in touch with you? DM us on Twitter or Instagram, or ask us a question in the help centre.
