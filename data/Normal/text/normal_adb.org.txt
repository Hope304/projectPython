Asian Economic Integration Report 2024 The European Union's (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), set to go into force in 2026, will impose import charges on products such as steel, cement, and electricity, based on the carbon dioxide emissions embedded in their production. The charges are aimed at curbing “carbon leakage,” the result of polluters moving production from countries with stringent regulations or high carbon prices to those with less stringent regulations or lower prices. However, CBAM is likely to reduce global carbon emissions by less than 0.2% relative to an emissions trading scheme with a carbon price of 100 euros ($108) per metric ton and no carbon tariff, statistical modeling shows. At the same time, the charges may reduce global exports to the EU by around 0.4% and Asia’s exports to the EU by around 1.1%, while negatively affecting the output of some manufacturers within the EU. Learn more about the latest Asian Economic Integration Report a ETS only means that European economies impose tighter ETS carbon allocations, with a resulting €100/MT price. There is no CBAM applied at the border.b ETS and CBAM means European economies impose tighter ETS carbon allocations, with a resulting €100/MT price.
