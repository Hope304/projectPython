Whether they're using a dedicated server, or sharing resources, every website is hosted on a server. The only way for a website to be visible on the internet is if it's hosted by a web hosting service provider, also known as a web host. In order to find a website, you type the domain name (or URL) into your browser. Your computer will then connect to the server where the website is hosted, and the webpage is delivered onto your screen.What Are the Different Types of Web Hosting Products DreamHost Offers?+DreamHost offers several different types of hosting plans that work for all website hosting needs.Shared HostingShared hosting is the most affordable option, but it does have its limitations. Shared hosting customers share the server's resources with other customers. If another website on the same server is receiving large amounts of traffic, or using a lot of the server's limited resources, it's possible that your site may run slower as a result. While DreamHost works hard to make sure all sites on a shared server never disrupt other sites, this is always a possibility due to the nature of the product. That's why we recommend that you look at our more powerful options if you're expecting to experience high traffic levels on your site.What can I host on shared hosting?Shared hosting is perfect for small and persona sites.Learn more about shared hostingManaged WordPress Hosting (DreamPress)DreamPress is DreamHost's managed WordPress hosting. It’s a high-performance hosting with premium built-in caching, staging, on-demand backups with one-click restore, and priority access to our WordPress support team.Shared vs. Managed WordPress HostingUnlike shared hosting, the resources included with managed WordPress hosting are only for your website so you won’t encounter performance issues when another website uses up the limited resources on the shared server. In addition, the server for managed WordPress hosting is specifically optimized for WordPress, ensuring better site performance.What can I host on Managed WordPress hostingManaged WordPress hosting is perfect for high-traffic, business, and database-driven sites built with WordPress.Learn more about DreamPressVPSDreamHost's Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting is a premium solution that runs faster than our shared hosting. It's available as an add-on to an existing DreamHost plan, but also as a standalone service. DreamHost's VPSs use Linux-VServer to create a "virtual machine" that protects a user's resources from others on the same physical machine. This allows for a more powerful solution.Shared vs. VPS HostingOn a shared server, resources are shared by other users. On a VPS, these resources are more isolated which improves performance and helps to maintain stability. You also have the ability to control how much RAM your server uses.What can I host on a VPS?A virtual private server is ideal for websites that require more resources than a shared server can provide, but may not need the full power of a dedicated server. VPS is ideal for businesses, ecommerce websites, designers, and developers that need unhindered performance.Learn more about VPSDedicatedA dedicated server is a server that only contains your files on it. You also get full root access: a major benefit if you're looking to customize your server to fit your specific needs. Please note that DreamHost support cannot assist if any errors occur as a result of a customization.Another benefit of a dedicated server is that your MySQL server is on the same server, allowing for faster access. With all other hosting plans your MySQL database is on a separate database server.What can I host on a Dedicated server?Dedicated servers are fully-managed, business class servers. They are perfect for resource-heavy apps and giant websites.Learn more about dedicated hostingCloudObject StorageDreamObjects is a cost-effective cloud storage service, which you can use to host static data for your websites, store backups, or develop the next big thing.
