With the launch of HEY World, everyone at Basecamp who was writing for SvN now has their own blog. Of course, we’ll keep the lights on here until the end of the internet. Enjoy exploring a decade plus of SvN: 2016 - 2021 2006 - 2015 2005 - 2006 Where you can follow us now: Jason Fried is on HEY World and Twitter. DHH is on HEY World and Twitter.
