Overcast Overcast Podcaster Info Ads Log In Overcast® Free, simple, award-winning podcast player for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Smart Speed® Pick up extra speed without distortion with Smart Speed, which dynamically shortens silences in talk shows. Conversations still sound so natural that youâ€™ll forget itâ€™s on — until you see how much extra time youâ€™ve saved. Voice Boost® Boost and normalize volume so every show is loud, clear, and at the same volume. Listen in more places, such as noisy cars, and still hear what everyone says without cranking the volume so high for quiet people that the loud ones blow your ears out.
