The best deal of the bunch is easily the Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $39.99, which matches the lowest price it has ever been. If you don’t want to spend that much, the similar Fire TV Stick 4K is on sale for $29.99, which is just $5 above its lowest price ever. I wouldn’t recommend it, but if you prefer to spend less and get a 1080p model, the Fire TV Stick Lite is $19.99 and the Fire TV Stick is $24.99. Both of those have been much cheaper in the past, but the days of $12 firesticks might be long gone. Lastly, the flagship Fire TV Cube is on sale for $114.99, which is just $5 more than the lowest price it has ever been.

It seems like Google may agree because 9to5Google has found evidence of a new unreleased model referenced in Google’s Home app. Read more › Posted in Article Tagged with: Google Chromecast, Google TV, Leak Google TV home screen update makes your apps more accessiblePosted by Elias Saba on February 28, 2024 — 5 Comments Google has announced a small but welcomed update to its Google TV home screen. The biggest change is the switch from rectangular to circular icons for the home screen’s “Your apps” row. While aesthetically differentiating app icons from the rectangular content icons, it also has the added benefit of increasing the number of visible apps from seven on the old design to nine on the new design. Comparatively, Fire TVs only show six app icons on the home screen.

One of those changes is the addition of an extremely easy to use virtual keyboard and basic remote that can be accessed by any web browser. While the Fire TV mobile app has existed for quite a while to serve as a virtual Fire TV remote, it can be cumbersome and slow to use, especially if all you want to do is type a single long password. While the new browser-based alternative keyboard/remote isn’t as capable as the Fire TV Remote app, it makes up for it in speed and simplicity.

The most recent Fire TV software update has blocked a Fire TV capability that has been present since the original model’s release in 2014. This is a basic Android capability that, to my knowledge, no other Android-based device manufacturer has ever had issues with, let alone blocked. This change has rendered popular Fire TV apps, which have been in Amazon’s own Appstore for years, useless. Worse yet, Amazon seems to have been careless in implementing this change without even a courtesy email to the affected app developers, all under the, seemingly false, guise of enhanced security.

However, Amazon has been quite quick to say “There are no changes to Freevee.” Given that you can already watch all Freevee content within the Prime Video app anyway, it may not be a bad idea to consolidate the two services.

With Walmart’s Onn streaming boxes and streaming sticks gaining in popularity, this acquisition, if approved by regulators, will give Walmart direct competition to Amazon’s Fire TV Smart TVs and Roku’s TVs.

Several people who subscribed to Paramount+ through Prime Video Channels just to watch the Super Bowl have told me that they were shown a hidden discounted offer during the cancelation process. Since canceling online and resubscribing takes just a few clicks and there’s no interruption in service, it’s probably worth trying to see if you can unlock a hidden offer for yourself.

The change was first spotted by 4KFilme and has been confirmed by an Amazon spokesperson. If you’re watching Prime Video content with ads, the best high dynamic range format you’ll see is HDR10+, which is comparable to Dolby Vision. However, it’s quite rare for content to be available in both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, so, more likely, you’ll see the inferior HDR10 format replacing Dolby Vision. Similarly, the best surround-sound audio format you’ll hear is Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. While this change will probably push some people to pay more, it may also be cutting costs for Amazon in terms of licensing fees to Dolby. Amazon made a similar cost-cutting decision with the cheaper Fire TV Stick Lite, which cannot decode Dolby audio, while the regular Fire TV Stick can decode Dolby audio, even though both streaming devices share identical hardware.

CBS, which has broadcasting rights this year to the big game, has chosen not to provide an easy free stream of the game for anyone, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t watch it without paying anything. Here are your best options for watching the Super Bowl for free on any Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Cube, or Fire TV Smart TV.
