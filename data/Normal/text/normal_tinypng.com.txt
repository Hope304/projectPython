GeneralHow does it workWeb compressorWeb Pro & Web UltraGeneralWhy should I compress my images for my website?Optimizing your images with the TinyPNG algorithm brings several benefits to your website. TinyPNG reduces file sizes by up to 80% without sacrificing quality, leading to faster page loads. This optimization is essential for keeping user attention and ensuring an enjoyable user experience. Additionally, it minimizes bandwidth usage, making your website more efficient and cost-effective. Image compression also plays a role in SEO, as efficiently compressed images contribute to faster page speeds and improve your website's search engine ranking.Does TinyPNG support WebP images?Yes, TinyPNG supports WebP images. Our compression feature enables users to achieve the most optimal results when working with WebP files.WebP, a web image file format created by Google, is supported by major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera. This format excels in achieving reduced file sizes while maintaining optimal image quality. Consequently, WebP images are smaller in size compared to PNG and JPEG counterparts, contributing to faster website loading times. This is particularly beneficial for your users, ensuring swift page load times and minimizing bandwidth costs, especially for mobile users.It’s worth highlighting that despite WebP’s inherent size advantages, Tinify’s optimization can further decrease the file size. The intelligent algorithm ensures that there are no visible differences while more savings are made.What does TinyPNG do?TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your WEBP, JPEG and PNG files. By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible but it makes a very large difference in file size!What file formats does TinyPNG support for image compression?Currently, Tinify supports WebP, JPG, PNG and APNG (animated PNG). We are continuously working to expand our portfolio to include additional formats in the future.Is the privacy of my images ensured?At Tinify, your privacy is our top priority. Rest assured, only you have access to the images you upload. We retain them for a maximum of 48 hours, after which they are permanently deleted.For additional details on privacy, please refer to our Terms of Use, specifically sections 8 and 9. These sections provide comprehensive information on privacy policies and data processing operations.Why did you create TinyPNG?Panda says: Excellent question! We frequently use PNG images but were frustrated with the load times. We created TinyPNG in our quest to make our websites faster and more fun to use with the best compression.In 2014 we added intelligent compression for JPEG images and in 2016 we added support for animated PNG. Compressing images with the website is free for everyone and we like to keep it that way! If you like TinyPNG please contribute by making a donationHow does it workWhat is lossy compression?Lossy compression is a method that reduces file sizes by removing certain data from the original file, often resulting in a loss of quality. However, with TinyPNG’s intelligent algorithm, we can achieve large savings without visible quality loss. Tinify uses smart lossy compression techniques to decrease the size of your pictures and make them ready for web use.How does TinyPNG optimize images without losing quality? Our compression engine employs a smart algorithm to determine the best optimization levels tailored to each image's unique content, considering factors like colors, textures, and patterns. Unlike one-size-fits-all approaches, we understand that each image requires specific compression settings for optimal results.Take, for example, the selective decrease in the number of colors within an image. This strategic approach not only maintains image quality but also significantly reduces the number of bytes needed to store the data. Thanks to our intelligent algorithm, the optimization process results in nearly invisible effects on the image while making a big difference in file size.How does PNG image compression work?Panda says: Excellent question! When you upload a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file, similar colors in your image are combined. This technique is called “quantization”. By reducing the number of colors, 24-bit PNG files can be converted to much smaller 8-bit indexed color images. All unnecessary metadata is stripped too. The result better PNG files with 100% support for transparency. Have your cake and eat it too!Unnecessary metadata is stripped as well. You will get an optimal image, every time!Why should I use TinyPNG to optimize my PNG files?PNG is useful because it’s the only widely supported format that can store partially transparent images. The format uses compression, but the files can still be large. Use TinyPNG to shrink images for your apps and sites. It will use less bandwidth and load faster.How does JPG image compression work?Panda says: Excellent question! When you upload a JPEG file, the image is analyzed. Textures, patterns and colors are automatically identified. The encoder creates an optimally compressed JPEG file based on that information. The final result is compared with the original and fine-tuned. Distracting JPEG artifacts are minimized without big sacrifices in file size. Unnecessary metadata is stripped as well. You will get an optimal image, every time!How does TinyPNG manage metadata during the compression process?TinyPNG removes all unnecessary metadata from the images to reduce file size.Please note that this process might result in the optimized image appearing with a different dpi (dots per inch) or color profile, as default values will be applied in the absence of metadata.If there's a need to preserve specific metadata from your images, consider exploring our Developer API. The API offers an option to retain certain metadata such as copyright, location, and creation date. Further details about this feature can be found in the API documentation.Are the optimized images supported everywhere?Panda says: Excellent question! The files produced by TinyPNG are displayed perfectly on all modern browsers including mobile devices. Still need to support Internet Explorer 6? It normally ignores PNG transparency and displays a solid background color. With TinyPNG the background becomes transparent again. Binary transparency without any workarounds!Is it safe to use animated PNG?Panda says: Excellent question! Chrome, Firefox, Safari and now Microsoft Edge all support APNG. Only Internet Explorer does not support the format yet.Apple added animated stickers to iMessage with the release of iOS 10. If you want to create and compress stickers under 500 KB take a look at the iMessage Panda sticker example on GitHub.Web compressorCan I compress my images for free? Certainly!
