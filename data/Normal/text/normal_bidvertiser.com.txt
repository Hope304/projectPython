Contextual Pops (Injection Traffic) are injected by browser toolbars and extensions and are triggered by domain names or keywords. Ads are injected as pop ads when the user types in a URL and/or search a keyword. ANY domain name can be targeted and the more popular it is – the more traffic will be triggered. Injection Traffic is Great for e-commerce, travel and any merchant-to-merchant campaigns. Native ads match the look & feel of the website in which they appear and unlike banner ads, they look less like ads and more like part of the editorial flow of the page.
