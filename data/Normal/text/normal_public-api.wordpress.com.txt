Below, you’ll find a full listing of all the available endpoints. As we add more endpoints, they will be automatically documented here and available through the Developer Console. If you’re not sure how to make calls to the API, you might want to check out the Getting Started guide or the walkthrough on authentication. For more information about a particular endpoint, click on its name under the Resource header. You’ll be taken to the endpoint’s documentation page, which includes what query parameters the endpoint will accept, what the JSON object’s parameters will be in the response, and an example query/response. If you’re looking for the WordPress REST API that shipped as part of WordPress core in version 4.7, see its documentation. Note that this API is also enabled on WordPress.com, but the URL structure on WordPress.com is slightly different than for self-hosted sites. See this post for more details.
