Gerard Adriaan Heineken bought this building back in 1863 when it was the De Hooiberg brewery. He then turned it towards the production of his eponymous beer. The building remained a brewery all the way up to 1988. It was then that it became a museum (and hotspot for Heineken consumption). Located in the vibrant neighborhood of De Pijp, the Heineken Experience is ideally situated for a canal cruise, and some city exploration that takes you away from the hustle and bustle of Dam Square. Since 2001, it's been the world-famous Heineken Experience. After a year-long update and redesign in 2008, the Heineken Experience is more Heineken-y and Experience-y than ever before. 4.6 (4,029) From €16.50 We are a proud partner of the world’s most-loved venues With more than 3,000 partners worldwide, Tiqets has a ticket for everyone.
