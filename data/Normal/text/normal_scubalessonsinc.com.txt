We generally teach either in aquatic centers with heated pools in the winter, or local crystal clear Florida Springs like Three Sisters, Peacock Springs, Troy Springs, Ponce Spring, De Leon Springs, Blue Springs, Devil's Den, Blue Grotto, and Alexander Springs in Central and North Florida and in Central Florida Lake Denton in Sebring or we go to beautiful beaches and ocean dives like Clearwater, Phil Foster Park|Blue Heron Bridge in West Palm Beach,Neptune's Memorial Reef in Miami, Spanish Rocks in Sarasota and other sites like Venice Beach, FL where someone just trying scuba for the first time can take away little treasures like old sharks teeth or white sand dollars for their first dive souvenier. We train and dive in the club all year long. In the winter months the springs are a balmy 72 degrees and in the summer we are usually east coast diving in the salty realm in our comfortable sunshine of about 83 to 89 degrees.

Conservation Club to find out more on the projects we are working on to better our underwater world! Our mission is: To make diving sustainable, affordable and available for EVERYONE to be able to see and explore the 71% of the world covered in water. We will work very hard to accomplish this mission. This organization is a not for profit program and all funding that goes in goes right back out to accomplish our mission by supporting various charities and programs. Please check out our conservation and club pages for more information on how we do this. We advocate for sharks, reef protection and restoration, handicapped divers, soldiers, disadvantaged kids, manatees, marine mammals, whales and dolphins and where ever else we see a need for education, hard work or research affecting the underwater world. Join the club! To extend this club to children we have also begun some time ago the 'Conservation Kidz program and it is now the heart of our organization. We quickly realized that children are the most impactful representation for conservation efforts and have found some kids that are down right powerhouses who get things done! We stand behind these kids and you can find out more on the Conservation Kids page in our links at the top. Here is one of our Conservation Kidz who won a scuba scholarship for her efforts in protecting turtles, Ms. Cori McWilliams in the video above. I hope you enjoy it! You will also see above a video about the concerns we have in protection measures needed on our Florida reefs and depicting a way you can as an eco tourist/citizen scientist help the endangered coral. This is just one of many ways that we encourage our students to keep on diving after they graduate. Our meet up group has a calendar with over 28 organizers who constantly plan ways you can help make the underwater world better and help us complete our mission. It can be allot of fun and hardly ever feels like work but you really do make a difference and that is what we are all about!
