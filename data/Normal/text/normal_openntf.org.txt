March OpenNTF Webinar: Domino Security - Not knowing is not an optionJesse Gallagher | 4 days ago | Comments Domino is secure, right? Well, kind of. But it is far from optimal in a default install, especially HTTP. DCT used to help, and currently DLAU is trying to be helpful in that area, but not knowing is not an option. HCL is constantly adding new security features, but are you aware of them? Are you using them? In this webinar you'll find practical, no-nonsense tips and tricks to further secure your Domino environment. And don't think security is just for administrators... developers also need to be aware of, and understand, and code for modern browser security features, such as CORS and CSP. The speaker for this webinar will be Darren Duke. Darren has been doing Notes/Domino stuff since he first came to America in 1996 to compete as part of the British Olympic Beer Drinking team in the Atlanta games. In 2005 he founded STS to provide clients with the service, knowledge, and education they need to make Domino great again. For a less-interactive version of Darren's wit and wisdom, visit https://blog.DarrenDuke.net This webinar will take place on March 21 from 11:00 AM (New York time) to 12:30 PM. Be wary of daylight-savings changes for your location.

Developers love DRAPI because it provides a modern method for updating and enhancing their applications. It is relatively easy to install, and in just a couple of minutes you have the restapi Domino server task running. But, because DRAPI runs on the Domino server, Domino Administrators need to become involved with its installation and administration. To have a production worthy system, there are configuration steps that need to be taken. Also, there are processes that should be followed when making a Domino database available through DRAPI. This webinar will provide you with an introduction to DRAPI, showing you how to install, configure and manage it on your Domino servers. This webinar will take place on February 15 from 11:00 AM (New York time) to 12:30 PM.

(Admittedly, earlier this month would have been a bit better of a time, but it’s been a busy start of the year.) Project Updates December saw the introduction of two wholly-new projects on the site: Search HCL Notes Desktop This project is an intriguing exercise in using some of the capabilities of the Domino JNA project to do a neat trick in the Notes client. Specifically, it uses Domino JNA’s ability to trawl your workspace to find databases and performs a search across them. This can be much nicer than the global search Notes normally provides, in that this will be your specific set of workspace applications. You can find the project here. Team Documents This project is a new Notes client application, useful for coordinating documents among your team. It highlights the traditional benefits of using Notes quite well, and is ready packaged to be deployed to your server. You can find the project here. Webinars and Repair Cafés Last month, we hosted our now-traditional end-of-year get-togethers for the community on Discord, and this month we’re resuming our Repair Café and Webinar schedule. Our webinar will take place on January 18th and will be a Deep Dive into Debugging Domino with the Divas and “the Dude”. To find out more, visit the blog post or go to register. Our Repair Café this month, for any topics, will be on the 25th in our Discord. All are welcome, whether or not you have an immediate problem - we encourage people to talk about interesting problems they solved recently, ask for opinions, or generally discuss the technologies we use. We have a solid slate of webinars scheduled already pretty much through the end of the year, and we heartily encourage you to join us.
