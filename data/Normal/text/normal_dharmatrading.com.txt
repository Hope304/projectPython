Your discount is figured on the total number of cotton and rayon items we ship, not how many of each type, style or size. Mix and match them to get the best discount. Example: adding 4 each of 3 different T-shirts in any sizes will give you the 12+ price on all 12 shirts. Some products may be excluded from discounts, and / or may discount only with themselves. If you have any questions at all please contact us toll free at 800-542-5227 (no buttons, just humans). Drag and Drop chips to the Palette first.
