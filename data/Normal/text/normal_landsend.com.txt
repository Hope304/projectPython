Beach-to-boardwalk lifestyle. There was a time when going to the beach meant a canvas tote filled up with two separate outfit changes, plus swim essentials and personal items. Thankfully, times have changed. Today's tankini bathing suits or swim dresses can often double as cover-ups for easy beach-to-boardwalk. No one will be able to tell that you're wearing your favorite tankini top and swim bottoms. Similarly, if you're concerned about coverage, support, and sun protection – our collection of modest swimwear has options like shorts and rash guards that double as your t-shirt and shorts. They provide coverage, support, sun protection – and save you on packing! Recommended by The Skin Cancer Foundation as adequate protection from UV rays, our modest swimsuits not only provide full-coverage and support but are also made of UPF 50 fabric. Carry your swim goddess status back home. The plus size swimwear that had you feeling like a total goddess while on your vacation doesn't have to hide back home. Stylish bikini tops, funky pattern bottoms, flowy swim skirts – rock anything and everything! An underwire one-piece swimsuit with a dramatic back is a sure bet, too. In Lands' End swimwear, you'll feel confident enough to shed the swimsuit cover up during vacation and comfortable enough to attend neighborhood pool parties back home. Get All the Plus Without the Minus Shopping for comfort and style as a plus-size woman can sometimes be challenging, but thankfully, Lands' End has you covered. We work hard crafting our size specs to make sure that our plus size line is made to flatter your body in comfort and style. When it comes to flattering plus size swimsuits, Lands' End is built for you. Choose your level of coverage and control, top to bottom - from plus size bikini tops to plus size tankinis. Looking for swim skirts and swim shorts that skim your thighs? How about tummy control swimsuits for just a little extra shaping? We've got it all, plus looks you never even knew you needed! Our women's plus size clothes are designed to give you the fit and style you want. Don't forget to check out our plus size one piece swimsuits with all-over control, specially designed with placed patterns and ruching to accent your best assets. Shop our long torso swimsuits and plus for taller figures as well. Now Let's Talk Trends This season, it's all about height. From women's pants to women's swimsuits and everywhere in between, high waists and high necklines are winning us over again and again. High waisted swimsuits flatter your figure by adding a bit of tummy control. High neck swimsuits (also available in high neck tankini tops) provide coverage, protection and a bit of modesty to your swim style. Not to mention they make your shoulders look amazing. You may also consider high-neck underwire tankini tops, if you're looking for a little extra support.
