Learn About Novelist » Posted by Ashley 19th November, 2022 Books Leather-bound, illustrated edition of Lord of the Fading Lands by C.L. Wilson In May I mentioned how I wanted to make my own special edition book. Well, I did it!! To recap: this idea started when I read about someone else making their own special edition book.

The writing was […] Posted by Ashley 17th May, 2021May 1, 2021 Books Far off 2022 releases to keep an eye on – adult SFF edition I already published a list of 2022 young adult fantasy books to watch, now here’s the adult SFF list! It’s mostly fantasy, with a sci-fi thrown in here and there. Most of these books don’t have covers, full release dates, or full synopsis yet. But […] Posted by Ashley 13th May, 2021May 2, 2021 Books Far off 2022 releases to keep an eye on – YA fantasy edition Most of these books don’t have covers or exact release dates yet, other than “sometime in 2022”.

Everyone says this series is amazing, one of the best, etc. Well I guess I’m the odd one out because wow that was boring! Malice is 634 pages, and yet nothing of note […] Posted by Ashley 10th May, 2021May 5, 2021 Books The pros and cons of requesting advanced reading copies I just checked my email, and if that’s correct, the last advanced reading copy (ARC) I requested and was approved for was in December 2017 (The Smoke Thieves by Sally Green).
