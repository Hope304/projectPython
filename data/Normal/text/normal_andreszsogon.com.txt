It allows the user to create, edit and fix external subtitle files in many formats, as well as embed subtitles permanently in AVI files using the external tool VirtualDub. It’s still being updated, widely used and supported in all Windows versions starting with XP onwards. The official homepage was moved here after closing the former divxland.org domain.

I’ve started with the design of simple HTML sites with FrontPage XP and Visual Basic programming around the year 2002, and shortly after moved to PHP front and backend development, and Android & iOS Apache Cordova mobile apps.
