DataPacRat's Warren A work in progress. The Wulf Archives, no longer available at the original location, provided here as a courtesy until the authour can find a new host. Further details available at WikiFur. Update: Anthony Pryor not only has a new website, but he has published the Wulf Archives as ebooks. I'm more interested in content than design, so expect the layout here to be as primitive as can be for some time to come. To start with, I'll be placing the data I've packratted away into four categories: True, False, Opinion, and Art. Blog Mastodon About & Contact
