TC EDBT Endowment CoPR IFIP Very Large Data Base Endowment Inc. (VLDB Endowment) is a non-profit organisation incorporated in the United States for the sole purpose of promoting and exchanging scholarly work in databases and related fields throughout the world. The Endowment serves as the steering committee for the VLDB conference series. The review process for these conferences is implemented in collaboration with PVLDB and the conference review process is entirely through PVLDB. Since 1992, the Endowment has published the VLDB Journal for disseminating archival research results. By now, the journal is one of the most successful journals across all of computer science. The VLDB Journal is published in collaboration with Springer-Verlag. On various activities, the Endowment closely cooperates with ACM SIGMOD. The Endowment also sponsors various scholarly activities. It has established a program that supports summer schools, and other training activities of this kind, in countries that could otherwise not afford the expenses for such events. The VLDB historical archives since 1995 contains web sites of past conferences, conference statistics (e.g., number of papers submitted, acceptance rates), and other useful information. The VLDB Endowment is governed by a Board of Trustees consisting of 21 members. VLDB's Position on Racism The VLDB Endowment is committed to ensuring that all VLDB activities are carried out in an inclusive and diverse environment with zero tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or any other form of misconduct. The database systems community wide DBCares initiative, co-started with ACM SIGMOD, is a realization of this principle. We cannot be satisfied with continuing the status quo. We will continue to actively stand against discrimination. We will find new ways to address the inequities that exist in our field. We will help to create an environment that is more welcoming, just, and equitable to all. We join ACM and CRA in stating that we will continue to listen, to learn, to engage and to explore new ways to fight against and reject racism. Silence perpetuates, doubt reinforces, and rationalization of incident after incident only compounds the pain so many in our society continue to endure. We know that racism: Is systemic and institutionalized. Continues to oppress people of color around the world â€“ denying basic human rights, denying opportunity, and even more tragically denying many of their very lives. Is learned behavior that may be unlearned through education, compassion, empathy, and action. Drives a wedge between communities, and in doing so limits the enviable quest for a society steeped in respect. Benefits the privileged from its existence, who must be willing to sacrifice to overcome it. To stand against it, we: Acknowledge the existence of racism within our communities and commit to defeating it. Call out and reject rationalization of incidents and distortion of information. Educate ourselves and those around us to address racism in its many forms. Stand up against the status quo by using our voice and agency. Invite the community to discuss concrete steps to take to create lasting change. Denton meds VLDB Endowment Inc. is hosted by Bluehost. Privacy Policy Last modified: May 28, 2021 06:00 AM.
