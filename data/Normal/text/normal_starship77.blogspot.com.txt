Heeeeeey!!! Well, it's been a while since I last posted "in-progress" stuff here. BUT, I decided that it's nice to have the shot's evolution posted in the blog, so people outside AM can follow it's progress. So here it is! This is my next dialogue shot in AM and this is the very first BLOCKING pass!

I just finished my first dialogue animation in AM! I still think there are many things that could be improved, but I'll leave that for the "Polishing and Portfolio" class next term... For now, I compiled another demo reel that I'll be taking to CTN Animation Expo next month! Can't wait!!

Here's a demo-reel I've put together while working on my dialogue shots. It has the body mechanics shots I most liked from class 1 to 4. I'll update it with my dialogue shots and maybe some other mechanics shots as soon as I finnish them. Hope you enjoy! =) Postado por Alan Starship às 1:12 AM No comments: Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Marcadores: Animation, animationmentor, demoreel Sep 27, 2011 1 YEAR! Hey it's my birthday again! And if you remember, my last birthday was also my first day at Animation Mentor! So, after 1 year, I'm glad to say I'm just as happy as I was in the first day about being in this school! It's AWESOME! Class 5 just started and soon I'll have a full dialogue shot (monologue actually) to share here! Meanwhile, here's my pantomime shot from class 4. Cheers!

I uploaded 3 of my class 2 animations and today I received an email saying I was highlighted in the main page! That's totally awesome! =Dhttp://www.youanimator.com/ Postado por Alan Starship às 9:38 PM 3 comments: Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Marcadores: Animation, news Jun 28, 2011 Yeeeeeeeeeaaaah!!! No, I didn't forget about this blog! Thing is: I don't wanna post a lot of WIPs here anymore, so I was waiting for my class 3 shots to be finished to post them. And, as you can figure by now, none of them got really "finished". =(The good news is that, I'm finally finishing them and I'll post soon! So, if you thought that this blog was abandoned, rest assured that it was not! =)Cheers!

It is the last assignment for Class 2! I still feel that it needs some adjustments, but Class 2 is over now, so, if I ever come back to it, it will be in a while, maybe after class 3 is over, cause we starting right away next week! Woot!! Anyway, I hope you enjoy it! Cheers!

If you're wondering why no week 6 post, I can explain (hehe): Week 6 was this same animation in rough spline, so I decided to wait a little more and show the final version instead. Hope you like it!
