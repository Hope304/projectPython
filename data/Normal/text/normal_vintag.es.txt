Vintage Everyday Vintage Everyday Bring back some good or bad memories ADVERTISEMENT March 5, 2024 Photographs of Playboy Founder Hugh Hefner at His Chicago Mansion in 1966 March 05, 2024 1960s, celebrity & famous people, life & culture Before he rose to fame in the 1950s, Hugh Hefner had served in the U.S. Army and worked in the magazine publishing industry, Playboy Enterprises said. The Chicago-born trailblazer first started circulating Playboy in December 1953 with money he borrowed from family and friends and with furniture he put up as collateral for a loan, the company said.In 2009, Hefner told TIME he “dramatically” changed the notion of sex in America. That was one of his proudest accomplishments, he told the New York Times in 1992. “That gives me great satisfaction,” he said.In 1966, Magnum photographer Burt Glinn embarked on an assignment to chronicle the late Playboy mogul Hugh Hefner during a typical evening at his home. Of course, an average night for the young magazine editor was anything but ordinary.At the time, Hefner was living in a James Bond-inspired, brick and limestone mansion on Chicago’s Gold Coast. The majestic abode was not only Hefner’s home but the locus of his sex-positive brand ― a bustling salon with a near constant influx of models, celebrities, writers, artists and socialites.Playboy’s archivist Steve Martinez provided context to accompany Glinn’s images for Magnum. He mentioned that, because of the close friendship Hefner had with Bond author Ian Fleming, the house had plenty of design choices that would delight an aspiring secret agent.“There was a painting and you’d push a button and the painting would rise and then there would be the TV set ― and back in those days nobody had that,” Martinez said. “On the floor, there was a trap door and you’d open it and down below you’d see people swimming. Another secret door would open to reveal a fireman’s pole, which you could use to slide all the way down to the bottom floor, towards the pool.”Architectural choices aside, the most striking aspect of Hefner’s mansion was the fact that, more often than not, it was crowded with young women in leotards and bunny ears. Hefner’s preferred lifestyle arrangement persisted when, in 1970, he left his Chicago manse to settle in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. The former Playboy headquarters is now luxury apartments.

In 1609, the English Virginia Company, which had established Jamestown in Virginia two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent it from sinking, then landed ashore. Bermuda’s first capital, St. George’s, was established in 1612.The Virginia Company administered the island as an extension of Virginia until 1614; its spin-off, the Somers Isles Company, took over in 1615 and managed the island until 1684, when the company's charter was revoked and Bermuda became an English Crown Colony. Following the 1707 unification of the parliaments of Scotland and England, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain, the islands of Bermuda became a British Crown Colony.When Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949, Bermuda became the oldest remaining British colony. It has been the most populous remaining dependent territory since the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. Bermuda became known as a "British Overseas Territory" in 2002, as a result of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002.

Little did founders Carl Jantzen, Roy and John Zehntbauer know that they would achieve both fame and controversy as swimwear pioneers. Producing a wool suit for a rowing team they began offering “bathing suits” in their catalog. Knit on sweater cuff machines, the suits became popular with swimmers. The demand increased for those “Jantzens” and the company name was changed in 1918 to Jantzen Knitting Mills. The suits were made of 100% pure virgin wool. Matching stockings and stocking cap completed the costume of the day. Early advertisements guaranteed the famous rib-stitch “gives that wonderful fit.”A national advertising campaign included billboards in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Cutouts and decals of the red Diving Girl appeared on windshields of automobiles across the country. Sales during the decade spread throughout Europe, the Americas and Asia. The red Diving Girl icon had become an international symbol. The Jantzen Swimming Association sponsored swimming education and clean water programs across the country. Endorsements by celebrities began with 1924 Olympic Games champions Johnny Weismuller and Duke Kahanamoku of Hawaii. Fashion became increasingly important. “Color Harmony,” a range of colors and color combinations, was introduced to suit the coloration of every swimmer.Jantzen catalogs featured upcoming movie stars, including Loretta Young, Joan Blondell, Ginger Rogers, and Dick Powell. National magazines such as Esquire, the Saturday Evening Post, Life, and Colliers published advertisements illustrated by George Petty, who became famous for his air-brush depictions of handsome men and shapely women. Jantzen’s philosophy of flattering the female form defined the company. In 1931, the introduction of the “Shouldaire” allowed strap-free tanning. An internal drawstring above the bustline allowed the shoulder straps to be dropped. The concept of “Molded Fit” defined the bustline. Lastex, a rubberized yarn, was blended into the fabric to allow better give to the suit. Synthetics, such as rayon, appeared with cotton or silk. Later in the decade, woven patterned fabrics in many color combinations made their debut.Business perked up in 1941 after Jantzen added sweaters, foundations (girdles) and active sportswear to its basic line. In December of that year, the attack on Pearl Harbor changed the economic picture through 1945. Production of civilian goods declined while military orders increased. Military items produced by Jantzen included sweaters, swim trunks, sleeping bags, gas mask carriers, and parachutes. With the war's end, the company stressed new styling by nationally known designers such as Louella Ballerino. Nylon was a preferred fabric. The bikini introduced in France in 1946, set the style for brevity in swimwear and became a worldwide fashion classic.Here, a collection of 25 wonderful adverts of Jantzen swimwear from the 1940s: See more» A Gallery of 50 Vintage Portraits of Beautiful Women in Photo Booth From Between the 1920s and 1940s March 04, 2024 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, beauty, fashion & clothing, female, photography, portraits A photo booth is a vending machine or modern kiosk that contains an automated, usually coin-operated, camera and film processor.
