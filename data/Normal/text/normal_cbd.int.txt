The Biodiversity Plan offers opportunities for cooperation and partnerships among diverse actors. Governments, indigenous peoples and local communities, non-governmental organizations, lawmakers, businesses, and individuals are encouraged to highlight the ways in which they are supporting the implementation of the Biodiversity Plan.

World Wetlands Day-- 2 February 2024 Today we celebrate World Wetlands Day #WWD2024. Wetlands provide home to 40% of the world’s biodiversity. Sadly, 1/3 of them have disappeared over the last 50 years. We must #ActforWetlands to safeguard these ecosystems & human wellbeing. The #BiodiversityPlan is key for that. pic.twitter.com/oxKz0o3O8Z — David Cooper (@hdavidcooper) February 2, 2024 This year's World Wetlands Day theme is "Wetlands and Human Wellbeing". Wetlands provide essential benefits for people. They deliver food and clean water, they store floodwaters and protect coastal communities from the impact of extreme events. And, they lock aware carbon and help to cool the planet. Wetlands also support livelihoods: Almost 1 billion households in Asia, Africa and the Americas rely on rice growing and processing for their main livelihoods. More than 660 million people depend on fishing and aquaculture for a living. But, wetlands are under threat. Over a third of the world’s wetlands have ... Three messages for biodiversity in the COP 16 logo Inspired by the Inírida flower, a species endemic to Colombia, the logo was unveiled in the margins of the 6th United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6), along with the Host Country’s slogan for COP 16: “Peace with Nature”. "This is a flower that never dies, its petals never fall apart. We hope that the COP 16 in Colombia can help the world to make peace with nature, so that we can sustain and maintain life on the planet forever," H.E Susana Muhamad said. Here are three important messages that the COP 16 logo and slogan convey: 1. The Biodiversity Plan constitutes an indivisible whole The petals represent the 23 targets of the Biodiversity Plan and the 13 ecoregions of Colombia, one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. The color palette symbolizes three pathways for action—reduce threats, meet people’s needs, and develop tools and solutions—and the need for synergies. “The eloquent logo featuring the Inírida flower speaks volum... Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals COP 14 -- 12 to 17 February 2024 The 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP14) is set to take place in the historic city of Samarkand, Uzbekistan, from 12 to 17 February 2024. The meeting will highlight the issues of: habitat conservation and restoration, threats to species such as overexploitation, habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, and climate change The conference will be convened under the slogan, "Nature knows no borders". This is a reminder that the journeys of migratory species do not adhere to political boundaries and that their survival is dependent on international collaboration and transboundary conservations efforts.

UNFCCC COP28 UAE and the Importance of Biodiversity Both within and outside the negotiations at the COP, nature was a clear winner. There were high level events and ministerial roundtables on harnessing 30x30 to tackle climate change and integrated implementation of national climate and biodiversity frameworks. There were also breakthroughs on mangrove restoration and protection and Sustainable Ocean Management – thanks to leadership of the COP28 Presidency, and in collaboration with the COP15 Presidency and many governments and other stakeholders, the importance of biodiversity was undoubtably a focal point. Within the formal negotiations, biodiversity was also well recognised in the first Global Stocktake, which noted the importance of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF). There was a focus in relation to forests, but also the importance of sustainable land management and healthy ecosystems, including oceans and mountains, in both the mitigation of and adaptation to the impacts of climate change. Equally, the ... On the road to COP 16 in Cali: three priority areas for action “We bow to the most biodiverse region of Colombia,” said H.E.

Programmes Thematic The Conference of the Parties (COP) has established seven thematic programmes of work (listed below) which correspond to some of the major biomes on the planet. Each programme establishes a vision for, and basic principles to guide future work. They also set out key issues for consideration, identify potential outputs, and suggest a timetable and means for achieving these. Implementation of the work programmes depends on contributions from Parties, the Secretariat, relevant intergovernmental and other organizations. Periodically, the COP and the SBSTTA review the state of implementation of the work programmes. Select Agricultural Biodiversity Dry and Sub-humid Land Biodiversity Forest Biodiversity Inland Waters Biodiversity Island Biodiversity Marine and Coastal Biodiversity Mountain Biodiversity Cross-Cutting The COP has also initiated work on key matters of relevance to all thematic areas. These cross-cutting issues correspond to the issues addressed in the Convention's substantive provisions in Articles 6-20, and provide bridges and links between the thematic programmes. Some cross cutting initiatives directly support work under thematic programmes, for example, the work on indicators provides information on the status and trends of biodiversity for all biomes. Others develop discrete products quite separate from the thematic programmes.
