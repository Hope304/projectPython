World Wetlands Day-- 2 February 2024 Today we celebrate World Wetlands Day #WWD2024. Wetlands provide home to 40% of the world‚Äôs biodiversity. Sadly, 1/3 of them have disappeared over the last 50 years. We must #ActforWetlands to safeguard these ecosystems & human wellbeing. The #BiodiversityPlan is key for that. pic.twitter.com/oxKz0o3O8Z ‚Äî David Cooper (@hdavidcooper) February 2, 2024 This year's World Wetlands Day theme is "Wetlands and Human Wellbeing". Wetlands provide essential benefits for people. They deliver food and clean water, they store floodwaters and protect coastal communities from the impact of extreme events. And, they lock aware carbon and help to cool the planet. Wetlands also support livelihoods: Almost 1 billion households in Asia, Africa and the Americas rely on rice growing and processing for their main livelihoods. More than 660 million people depend on fishing and aquaculture for a living. But, wetlands are under threat. Over a third of the world‚Äôs wetlands have ... Three messages for biodiversity in the COP 16 logo Inspired by the In√≠rida flower, a species endemic to Colombia, the logo was unveiled in the margins of the 6th United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6), along with the Host Country‚Äôs slogan for COP 16: ‚ÄúPeace with Nature‚Äù. "This is a flower that never dies, its petals never fall apart. We hope that the COP 16 in Colombia can help the world to make peace with nature, so that we can sustain and maintain life on the planet forever," H.E Susana Muhamad said. Here are three important messages that the COP 16 logo and slogan convey: 1. The Biodiversity Plan constitutes an indivisible whole The petals represent the 23 targets of the Biodiversity Plan and the 13 ecoregions of Colombia, one of the most biodiverse countries in the world.

Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals COP 14 -- 12 to 17 February 2024 The 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP14) is set to take place in the historic city of Samarkand, Uzbekistan, from 12 to 17 February 2024. The meeting will highlight the issues of: habitat conservation and restoration, threats to species such as overexploitation, habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, and climate change The conference will be convened under the slogan, "Nature knows no borders". This is a reminder that the journeys of migratory species do not adhere to political boundaries and that their survival is dependent on international collaboration and transboundary conservations efforts.

Previous Next David Cooper | Acting Executive Secretary, CBD Secretariat The United Nations Secretary-General has designated Dr. David Cooper as Acting Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as of 15 February. Prior to his appointment, David had been the Deputy Executive Secretary at the CBD Secretariat since October 2015, where he assisted the Executive Secretary by leading the strategic and planning activities of the Secretariat, as well as the intergovernmental processes and activities under the Convention and its two protocols -- the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing. Programmes Thematic The Conference of the Parties (COP) has established seven thematic programmes of work (listed below) which correspond to some of the major biomes on the planet. Each programme establishes a vision for, and basic principles to guide future work. They also set out key issues for consideration, identify potential outputs, and suggest a timetable and means for achieving these. Implementation of the work programmes depends on contributions from Parties, the Secretariat, relevant intergovernmental and other organizations. Periodically, the COP and the SBSTTA review the state of implementation of the work programmes. Select Agricultural Biodiversity Dry and Sub-humid Land Biodiversity Forest Biodiversity Inland Waters Biodiversity Island Biodiversity Marine and Coastal Biodiversity Mountain Biodiversity Cross-Cutting The COP has also initiated work on key matters of relevance to all thematic areas. These cross-cutting issues correspond to the issues addressed in the Convention's substantive provisions in Articles 6-20, and provide bridges and links between the thematic programmes. Some cross cutting initiatives directly support work under thematic programmes, for example, the work on indicators provides information on the status and trends of biodiversity for all biomes. Others develop discrete products quite separate from the thematic programmes.
