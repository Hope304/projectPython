Image credit: PLOS 01/19/2024 Research Article Identifying essential factors for energy-efficient walking control across a wide range of velocities in reflex-based musculoskeletal systems Humans can generate and sustain a wide range of walking velocities while optimizing their energy efficiency. Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing human walking will contribute to the engineering applications such as energy-efficient biped robots and walking assistive devices.

Image credit: NASA 01/19/2024 Research Article The structure and robustness of ecological networks with two interaction types Understanding how species interact and how this affects the robustness of ecological communities to species loss is essential to anticipate the consequences of biodiversity losses and extinction cascades as well as to design protection and restoration plans. Image credit: Ivan Bandura 01/26/2024 Research Article Short-term Hebbian learning can implement transformer-like attention The transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable, seemingly cognitive-like abilities, including few-shot and single-shot learning, puzzle solving, computer programming, image generation and style transformationsâ€¦ Image credit: Ian T Ellwood 12/06/2023 Research Article Major depressive disorder and bistability in an HPA-CNS toggle switch Major depressive disorder is the most common psychiatric disorder and has a complex and heterogeneous etiology. Most treatments take weeks to show effects and work well only for a fraction of the patients. Thus, new concepts are needed to understand MDD and its dynamics. Image credit: Damir Samatkulov 12/04/2023 Research Article Sparsity in an artificial neural network predicts beauty: Towards a model of processing-based aesthetics This study leveraged the capacity of artificial intelligence to model information processing in the human brain, to evaluate how the beauty of human faces and artistic paintings can be predicted from the efficiency of the neural code. Image credit: Alina Grubnyak 12/08/2023 Research Article The neurocognitive role of working memory load when Pavlovian motivational control affects instrumental learning It remains unknown how constraints on working memory resources affect instrumental learning under Pavlovian influence.
