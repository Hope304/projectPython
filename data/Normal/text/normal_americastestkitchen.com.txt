We started by slightly undercooking the pasta in 3 quarts of water to ensure that plenty of starch was in the cooking water. After reserving some cooking water and draining the pasta, we added a glug of olive oil and plenty of sliced garlic to the now-empty pot to cook over medium-low heat until the garlic was fragrant. We quickly added in some plump little capers, spicy red pepper flakes, and the cooked pasta along with 2 cups of the starchy cooking water. After bringing the liquid to a boil, we tossed the pasta constantly, not stopping until the water was nearly all absorbed and the pasta was al dente. This motion helped create something like an emulsion around the still-cooking pasta, a velvety sauce that was ready for a can or jar of flaked tuna, a shower of Parmesan, and some chopped parsley.Start CookingBryan RoofThis inexpensive weeknight steak dinner isn't shy on flavor.For a fresh take on steak, salad, and potatoes, we added flavor-packed powerhouse ingredients such as briny feta cheese; tangy-sweet balsamic vinegar; and bright, crunchy radishes.Start CookingWe tasted this unique polenta dish on a trip to Rhode Island. Here's how to recreate it at home.For the perfect texture, we had to figure out a liquid in which to cook the polenta. Cooking the polenta in half-and-half gave us inconsistent results. Some batches were gloppy, while others turned out bricks. Ditching the half-and half for water gave us not only better flavor but also an airy texture—the fat in the dairy had been weighing it down. The switch also showcased the corn’s sweetness and the Pecorino Romano’s nuttiness. Using a two-step cooking process, first on the stove and then in the oven, simplified matters. When reheated and topped with a sweet yet savory tomato sauce, our fluffy polenta is substantial enough to serve as an entrée.Start CookingKatie LeairdThis orzo salad is balanced and substantial without being too hefty.We quickly decided that orzo was our pasta of choice for this easy salad. Its small shape performs its supporting role perfectly, providing just enough bulk to make the salad satisfying but not so much that it becomes too filling. After all, we wanted this salad to be light without being too hefty. Pecorino adds some nuttiness, radicchio contributes welcome bitterness, and chickpeas provide a nice textural contrast.Start CookingAshley MooreOur Lemon Bars use ample amounts of both juice and zest for tart, bold flavor in every bite.For bright citrus flavor, successful lemon bars depend on ample amounts of fresh lemon juice, yes, but also a generous amount of lemon zest, which provides round, floral notes. We used four lemons for our lemon curd filling, which yielded a whopping ⅔ cup of juice and ¼ cup of zest. The other major ingredient for lemon curd is eggs, and lots of them. Two whole eggs and seven yolks gave us a luxurious curd with good thickening properties. To tame the curd's pucker power and make it ultracreamy, we added a small amount of heavy cream and some butter. Confectioners' sugar contributed a tender texture to the crust.Start CookingJackfruit is a shreddable, savory substitute for shredded meat in this Mexican-style tinga taco.Although it's related to the tiny fig, the jackfruit is the largest tree fruit in the world, weighing up to 80 pounds! In its mature (that is, ripe) form, jackfruit tastes like a combination of papaya, pineapple, and mango. However, green, immature jackfruit is altogether different: vegetal, dense, and very fibrous. When canned in water or brine, green jackfruit tastes more like an artichoke heart than a fruit, and it is widely used in many Asian cuisines as a meat substitute. Once cooked, it shreds beautifully into tender morsels reminiscent of pulled pork or chicken. We tried jackfruit as a substitute for shredded meat in a range of recipes (shawarmas, gyros, barbecue-style sandwiches), and our favorite was this Mexican-style tinga taco. We started by crisping the jackfruit in the skillet and then set it aside and built a savory sauce using tomato sauce enriched with aromatic onion, garlic, and oregano, plus some chipotle chiles in adobo sauce for smoky depth. After a few minutes simmering in the sauce, the jackfruit was tender enough to mash into a rich, flavorful taco filling, which we served in corn tortillas, topped with a bright, aromatic slaw and creamy avocado pieces.Start CookingNicole KonstantinakosAre You Cleaning Your Insulated Tumbler Correctly?Here’s a hint: your dishwasher may not be enough. Keep ReadingChase BrightwellThe secret ingredient for supermoist, perfectly cooked salmon? Time.Though slow roasting is an uncommon method for cooking fish, here it gave us ultratender, buttery salmon. First we sprinkled the fish with a mixture of brown sugar and salt to evoke the flavors of cured salmon. A very low 250-degree oven kept the fish from overcooking and minimized any carryover cooking once it was out of the oven. We then poured a light, bright mixture of extra-virgin olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, and chives over the succulent fish.Start CookingAlli BerkeyFor hundreds of years, Tuscan cooks have made pici pasta using just their hands. You can, too.Pici (pronounced “PEE-chee,” or sometimes “PEE-shee”), are made of long, wonderfully chewy strands that have been rolled out on Tuscan tables since Etruscan times. Pici are inherently frugal too and simple to make. Just mix together a dough of mostly flour and water then knead until smooth, let it relax a bit, then roll pieces of dough into slim ropes. Once boiled, they’re an ideal canvas for all sorts of sauces and toppings from mushrooms and sausage to tomato sauce and 'nduja. Pair this hearty, homey dish with a crisp, light salad.Start CookingAndrea GearyThis Durban-style roast chicken one-pan dinner couldn't be easier.Inspired by Madhur Jaffrey's recipe, we wanted to make a full chicken dinner with a similar flavor profile. We chose bone-in chicken pieces to avoid having to carve a whole bird. For the vegetables, we opted for cauliflower and potatoes since they would cook at a similar rate. We coated the chicken and vegetables in a spice puree made of lemon juice, olive oil, ginger, garlic, sweet curry powder, and garam masala, which provided a deeply complex hit of fragrant spice. Placing the chicken skin side up atop the vegetables in a baking dish and baking everything together in a 425-degree oven ensured that the fat in the chicken skin was rendered nicely. Since the vegetables were still a smidge too firm when the chicken was finished cooking, we removed the chicken and popped the vegetables back into the oven for 10 minutes while the chicken rested.Start CookingCJCecelia JenkinsWe scoured Pittsburgh’s Polish Hill neighborhood for the secrets to these popular dumplings.The authentic recipe we tried for these Polish dumplings (traditionally stuffed with a mixture of mashed potatoes and cheese or sauerkraut) called for a mix of all-purpose and semolina flours, and the dumplings couldn’t have been better. But what if you can’t find semolina flour at your local market? We tried substituting bread flour for the two flours and were happy with the pillowy, tender results. We found that the key to a perfect filling is to melt the butter and fully incorporate the other filling ingredients into the mashed potatoes. An easy-to-follow filling and folding technique makes quick work of forming the dumplings.Start CookingKatie LeairdHow to Weigh Ingredients and Why It’s So ImportantDigital scales are key for accuracy in the kitchen.Keep ReadingAndrea GearyThis rich, tender, fun-to-make babka has a luscious chocolate filling.For a rich, chocolaty babka loaf, we started with a yeasted dough that we flavored with orange zest and vanilla. Then we made a luscious chocolate filling by microwaving butter and chocolate together and stirring in confectioners’ sugar, cocoa, and salt until the filling was smooth. To combine them, we rolled the dough out to an 18 by 12-inch rectangle, spread the filling over it, and rolled it into a tight log. To ensure layers of chocolate throughout the loaf, we split the log in half lengthwise, laid the halves next to each other cut sides up, and twisted them together five times total. We baked the loaf uncovered for 30 minutes and then covered it with foil to finish baking. For an extra-special finish, we made a sugar syrup and brushed it over the warm babka.Start CookingMark HuxsollChickpeas are your ticket to a straightforward and satisfying chopped salad.Our hearty, chickpea-centric chopped salad began with zapping the chickpeas in the microwave to dry out their plump interiors and rupture their exteriors. Then, pan-frying the slightly dehydrated legumes caused their papery skins to blister and crackle while their dense insides puffed and crisped. We tossed the crunchy chickpeas with a zippy spice mix and set them aside to cool before scattering them atop a salad of arugula, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, sweet-hot Peppadew peppers, and salty-rich feta. A gutsy honey-Dijon vinaigrette finished things off with sweetness and tang.Start CookingSteve DunnCrispy tofu takes the place of chicken in this vegetarian version of katsu.We wanted a crispy tofu version of a Japanese favorite often made with crunchy chicken. To complement the crispy fried tofu, we served the tofu with a light cabbage salad with scallions and lemon. In order to help season the tofu breading, we add soy sauce to our egg and flour dredging mixture. For our coating and panko to stick, we pat our tofu cubes dry before breading and shallow frying them in a nonstick skillet. After just 3 minutes per side our tofu was perfectly golden and crunchy. For ease, we used bottled tonkatsu sauce to drizzle over our tofu just before serving.
