Anderson, reversing the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to remove former President Donald Trump from the state’s ballot. OPINION ANALYSIS Supreme Court rules states cannot remove Trump from ballot for insurrection By Amy Howe on March 4 at 12:09 p.m. In an unsigned ruling on Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot disqualify former President Donald Trump from the ballot for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the U.S. Capitol. The court held that only Congress can enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars former officers of the United States who “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” from holding office again, against candidates for federal offices. Although the court did not say so expressly, decisions in Maine and Illinois will presumably also be reversed in light of Monday’s decision.

Virginia Tech, the school at the center of the dispute, had changed its policy since being sued. SCOTUS NEWS Supreme Court takes up Trump immunity appeal By Amy Howe on Feb. 28 at 5:31 p.m. In a one-page order on Wednesday evening, the court agreed to decide whether former President Donald Trump can be tried on criminal charges that he conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump claims he has presidential immunity from prosecution. The case will be heard in April. ARGUMENT ANALYSIS Supreme Court split over bump-stock ban By Amy Howe on Feb. 28 at 3:41 p.m. While some justices at oral argument worried about how bump-stock owners would fare under a 2018 regulation that criminalized a product they already owned, others suggested that, with the ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, semiautomatic rifles equipped with bump stocks were precisely the kind of weapons Congress intended to bar as “machine guns.” SCOTUStalk Since 2017, the Supreme Court has significantly increased its use of the process by which the justices hear and resolves emergency appeals, sometimes known as the shadow docket. Professor Stephen Vladeck has closely tracked that change in recent years and joins Amy to discuss his new book The Shadow Docket.

Suski was the court’s second case in February under the Federal Arbitration Act, and by all accounts this one will be a lot easier for them to resolve than Bissonnette v. LePage Bakeries. Coinbase is a technical dispute about the “delegation clause” in an arbitration agreement, which “delegates” to the arbitrator not only the job of resolving the dispute between the parties, but also the threshold question whether any particular dispute falls within the arbitrator’s authority. Here, the customers are complaining about a Dogecoin sweepstakes that the cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase ran in 2021, and they are trying to keep that dispute out of arbitration. And it probably is relevant that this is the second time this dispute has been before the justices – just eight months ago in Coinbase v. Bielski the justices ordered the trial court to stay its proceedings pending the result of the seemingly interminable litigation about whether the case should go to arbitration. As the case comes to the court this time, the only issue is who – the district court or the arbitrator – should decide whether the dispute belongs in arbitration. Coinbase points to its user agreement, which carefully and explicitly calls for arbitral resolution of that question for all disputes with its customers of any kind; the customers point to the sweepstakes rules, which (presumably by mistake) fail to mention arbitration and choose California courts as the venue for any litigation.

Bank of America revealed a bench of justices struggling to reconcile provisions of the National Bank Act that protect national banks with a New York statute requiring all banks (including national banks) to pay interest on the escrow accounts they hold for their mortgage customers. The justices seemed disinclined to agree with what either of the parties had to say, so it is not obvious how they will resolve this one. Jonathan Taylor appeared for the customers seeking interest on their accounts. Taylor’s basic pitch was that Bank of America is obligated to pay interest because it failed to prove that paying interest would “significantly interfere” with the bank’s activities, in the words of a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that sets the relevant preemption standard. The problem for the justices, especially Justices Samuel Alito and Elena Kagan, is that deciding whether an interest requirement “significantly interfere[s]” with a bank’s activities seems like a pretty fact-laden inquiry. Alito, for example, commented: “So a district judge … is going to have a trial to determine the effect of this on all national banks operating in New York. And is that going to involve extensive discovery? Would it involve testimony by experts? … It’s at least a heavily factual question.” Continue ReadingMORE POSTS Calendar March 2023SuMoTuWeThFrSa123Conferenceprivate_conferences456Ordersorders7891011121314151617Conferenceprivate_conferences181920OrdersordersArizona v.
