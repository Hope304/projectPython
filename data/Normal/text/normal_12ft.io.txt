12ft We can't find the internet Attempting to reconnect Something went wrong! Hang in there while we get back on track âœ¨ Now Available on iOS Browse a cleaner web! Remove popups, banners, and ads from any website. Clean Webpage Clean any webpage, https://12ft.io/ <URL> Works with your favorite websites FAQ What? Prepend 12ft.io/ to the URL webpage, and we'll try our best to remove the popups, ads, and other visual distractions. Why? I believe Google Adwords killed the web. Google Adwords incentivized sites to peddle SEO optimized garbage. Sites who aren't are forced to optimize for email capture so they can market directly to you. Search results now show "news", ads, and SEO spam instead of surfacing information. You ought to be able to search something on Google and get an answer to your question without signing up for some newsletter. This is why I created 12ft.io. How does it work? Turns out most of the visual distractions on webpages are loaded after the page renders via javascript. All we do is disable the javascript of the site. This obviously doesn't work for all websites, but it works for a surprisingly large proportion of them. This is generally the case because most sites want to be indexed by Google and other search engines which have historically not run the javascript. Give it a shot on your favorite website to see how clean a JS-free version of the website is. Disclaimer We do not support using 12ft to violate the terms of service or copyright of other websites. This is merely a service to view webpages without javascript enabled. @thmsmlr Contact Us
