WorldWind allows application developers to quickly and easily create interactive visualizations of geographical information in a 3D planetary context. Organizations around the world use WorldWind to monitor weather patterns, visualize cities and terrain, track vehicle movements, analyze geospatial data and educate humanity about the Earth.What WorldWind is used for Explore a WorldWind demoFeatures and BenefitsIt's open sourceBecause WorldWind is completely open source, extending the API is simple and easy to do. This creates a powerful platform for giving any application the means to express, manipulate and analyze spatial data. WorldWind technology can be incorporated into a wide range of applications, including Windows, Mac, Linux, web, and mobile devices.Build what you wantWorldWind is different from a 3D globe like Google Earth because it is not an application. Instead, it is an SDK (software development kit) that software engineers can use to build their own applications. WorldWind provides a geographic rendering engine for powering a wide range of projects, from satellite tracking systems to flight simulators.NASA does the heavy liftingWith WorldWind handling the hard work of visualizing geographic data (generating terrain from elevation models, selecting and displaying images from imagery servers, etc), software engineers are free to focus on solving the problems specific to their own domains and more easily building whatever geospatial applications they choose.Get StartedWeb WorldWindCreate a web app or simply embed a globe in your page.
