Immediately installed on all my clientâ€™s sites. Saved my bacon numerous times. bluesix @bluesix Wordfence review Wordfence is a top-notch plugin, even the free version has tons on functions. I strongly recommend it for not only the newbie web-designer but also the experienced one as well. It is undoubtedly a great product. Steve F. sfekete111 Wordfence site-cleaning team saved my client big time Iâ€™ve have the Wordfence plugin (free version) on dozens of my personal and client sites for a few years. Easy to install and configure, itâ€™s blocked many attacks and Iâ€™ve never had a site hacked that had it. On one client site, we didnâ€™t use it, they got hacked and it was nasty, they sell tickets to their events and their payment system stopped taking payments (and gave some customers virus/malware). Not just one site, but the clientâ€™s entire hosting account was infected. I contacted Wordfence for a site cleaning and they got on it right away. In two days, the site was cleaned and taking payments again. Wordfence running on the sites after the cleaning reported a malware backdoor in my wptwin site-cloning script. I sent the report and the wptwin.php script to the security analyst who cleaned the site and within a few hours, he replied that indeed this was a false positive. That was great service and set me at ease that the clientâ€™s site had not become re-infected. imagiNed @imagined Thank you very much for providing such a good plugin and service Having researched and trialed various security plugins Wordfence wins hands down each time. All our websites are running Wordfence Premium and this plugin has served us very well for several years and the support team are second to none. As a small business there are an array of tasks to take care of and it is a very small price to pay for Wordfence Premium to take care of an extremely important task and is worth every penny. A reliable security plugin is paramount but it goes without saying this must be backed up by a good technical support team who can assist you when there is a problem. The Wordfence technical support goes beyond the call of duty and their knowledge is very reassuring when things go awry with your website. Phil provided an excellent service giving us the confidence we are with the right people who really know what they are doing and can explain and assist in a very succinct, knowledgeable and helpful manner. Having numerous plugins running on a WordPress website can result in all manner of conflicts, never mind issues that maybe caused by the hosting services used which can be a nightmare to unravel without the right technical support at hand. Wordfence not only protects your website from being hacked but provides a wealth of advice and excellent technical support when needed. Thank you very much for providing such a good service. aristocats aristocats Awesome Plugin and Premium Support Wordfence Premium has provided excellent customer service. The plugin is easy to use, and the premium support is friendly and informative. Very happy with their service. docmolly @docmolly Amazing, Must-have for WP Site security My small business WP Site got hacked (built, installed and maintained by me) and a cryptocurrency miner was hidden somewhere in my code. I spent a week trying to eliminate that code, and my Host also looked for it, without success, meanwhile I looked like a jerk trying to mine cryptocurrency from clients and potential clients! I tried several other WP security plugins, and web scan sites, but none could find or fix my problem. I downloaded and installed Wordfence, it found and repaired my problem in less than 5 minutes! Iâ€™ve since enabled many of its additional features and have been stunned to learn just how many attempts there are daily to log into my page! No wonder it got hacked. Some jerk even set up a new username for himself! Anyhow, Iâ€™ll never have any other WP page without Wordfence, and neither should you! Amazing plugin, very simple and very powerful. Cain57 @cain57 Excellent support and the best security plugin We have been using Wordfence (free version) for years on all our 100+ WordPress websites. We havenâ€™t had any hacked websites since then. Just recently we purchased the premium license to increase the security of our websites even more. We had some questions regarding a multi WP install on the same domain in various subfolders and received timely and professional support within a day. Everything is setup properly now and we sleep quietly at night knowing that itâ€™s all secured. ByteMotion @bytemotion Best Money I Spend! Wordfence is by far the best and most important plug-in I have installed on every site I maintain. The free version is good, but the premium version is worth every penny and more. In fact, I refuse to create or maintain a site without it. daisy2love daisy2love Wordfence is the best! Iâ€™ve been using Wordfence for some time now on 6 of my sites. It works extremely well and provides me with the protection from intruders that I need. Iâ€™ve only had a couple of minor issues, mostly caused by my lack of experience, but the support at Wordfence has been great at helping me out of a jam. I highly recommend the plugin, and purchasing the upgrade to the pro version is worth every penny. The plugin is easy to install and setup is simple. And.. if your host is GoDaddy, it is one of their recommended plugin partners. lairbear @lairbear Fantastic Support â€“ The Best Solution for a Hacked Website If you know the horror of having your website hacked, you know the mountain of stress that comes with it. Even worse is trying to find a solution to fix your hacked website for a reasonable price without being overly sold to. This is where WordFence comes in to save the day. They very quickly and thoroughly fixed my hacked website, keeping me updated with the status at all times. I also received a long report detailing what was hacked, how it was fixed, and instructions to secure my website from future hacks. In a matter of days, my site was unblacklisted by Google and Iâ€™m back in business! While I canâ€™t yet speak to how well WordFence secures your website from hacks, I can say that they have been the best solution for fixing my hacked website. Based on that experience, I have no problem entrusting them with securing my website going forward. THANK YOU WORDFENCE! It was worth every penny. suzippy @suzippy This site uses cookies in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
