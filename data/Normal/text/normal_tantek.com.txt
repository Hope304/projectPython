Saw pal Henri after changing into my trail shoes in the Lake Chabot Regional Park parking lot. The storms had scared many away, fewer than 100 showed up to the combined 30k & 50k start. The muddy rainy adventure began when we veered off the initial paved trail around the lake and onto a rocky uphill stretch. It was mostly an out-and-back course, with a bit of a loop in the middle. On the second half of that loop there was one fork in the trail without race markings. After spending minutes taking a peek down both options, I guessed right. About a half mile later a wooden trail post validated my choice.I kept a sustainable run/hike pace, with some sliding in the mud, stepping around many ruts and puddles of unknown depths. Slower finish than 5 years ago¬≤, yet this time with a negative split, and earned my first DLF award!#30k #RedtailRidge #trailRun #trailRunner #runner #trailRunning #running #2024_048¬π https://tantek.com/2023/178/t1/june-trailrunner-ultrarunner¬≤ https://tantek.com/2019/048/t1/finshed-chabot-redtailridge-30k-pr 00:38 on 2024-02-20 likes @beep@follow.ethanmarcotte.com reply at 23:34, @molly0xfff@hachyderm.io reply at 23:32, @molly0xfff@hachyderm.io toot at 23:31, @accordionpolar@indieweb.social reply at 23:30, @stevenjmesser@indieweb.social reply at 23:29, @nemobis@mamot.fr reply at 23:28, @lars@mastodon.social reply at 23:27, @KevinMarks@xoxo.zone reply at 23:23, @zeldman@front-end.social toot at 23:22, and @matthiasott@mastodon.social toot at 23:20 on 2024-02-19 ‚Ü≥ In reply to hachyderm.io user molly0xfff‚Äôs post @mollywhite.net (@molly0xfff@hachyderm.io) my #IndieWeb blog is https://tantek.com/ with all posts & responses, @tantek.com #federated via #BridgyFed for posts & #fediverse @-@-responses¬π, and lastly a time-delayed¬≤ Atom feed¬≥ for top-posts only (notes, articles, sometimes photos)¬π https://tantek.com/2023/019/t5/reply-domain-above-address-and-silo¬≤ https://indieweb.org/publish_delay¬≥ https://tantek.com/updates.atom 14:42 on 2024-02-19 New this week: the #IndieWeb community deployed a major modern update to the design, usability, and cross-device support of the https://indieweb.org/ home page and wiki in general! In brief:* Updated MediaWiki install, updated themes, better mobile device support* New default theme: Vector (2022), the same as English Wikipedia* Lots of CSS fixes for content, sidebars, etc.* Home page content simplification and more pleasing design updateLots more details on the 2024 homepage and design update project page:* https://indieweb.org/2024/homepageThis was a community effort, with many people pitching in with major & minor contributions, spending weeks, days, hours, or a few minutes here and there helping out. From server work, to PHP coding, to HTML+CSS (re)coding, to testing variants of MediaWiki themes, browsers, and devices.Huge thanks in particular to @PaulRobertLloyd.com (@paulrobertlloyd@mastodon.social) for both driving this design update (e.g. said project page) and doing the heavy lifting of debugging, patching, and testing the latest MediaWiki Vector theme, documenting before & after screenshots, and @AaronParecki.com (@aaronpk@aaronparecki.com @aaronpk) for all the server-side software updates, PHP/IndieAuth wrangling, and critical devops too.Go try the new https://indieweb.org/ on any browser, on any device, and share your experience!#IndieNewsThis is post 11 of #100PostsOfIndieWeb. #100Posts‚Üê https://tantek.com/2024/046/t1/the-ephemeral-web‚Üí üîÆ 14:25 on 2024-02-16 likes @thisismissem@hachyderm.io reply 17:03 on 2024-02-15 A couple of days ago in an informal discussion in the #indieweb chat channel about how different people view #Mastodon, the #fediverse, or #Bluesky, and services like #Bridgy & #BridgyFed quite differently, I noted¬π that one big unspoken difference was how things on the web last over time, from the traditional persistent web, vs the newer and growing ephemeral web.There is the publicly viewable #OpenWeb that many of us take for granted, meaning the web that is persistent, that lasts over time, and thanks to being #curlable, that the Internet Archive archives, and that a plurality of search engines see and index (robots.txt allowing). The HTML + CSS + media files declarative web.Then there are the https APIs that return JSON "web", the thing that I‚Äôve started calling the ephemeral web, the set of things that are here today, briefly, gone tomorrow. I‚Äôve previously used the more provocative phrase js;dr (JavaScript required, Didn‚Äôt Read) for this #ephemeralWeb, yet like many things, it turns out there is a spectrum from ephemeral to persistent.One popular example on that spectrum that‚Äôs closer to the ephemeral edge is anything on a Mastodon server running v4 (or later as of this writing) of the software. (I‚Äôm not bothering to discuss the examples of walled garden social media silos because I expect we will continue to see their demise¬≤ over time.)For example, the Internet Archive version of the shutdown notice for the queer(.)af Mastodon server, is visibly blank:https://web.archive.org/web/20240112165635/https://queer.af/@postmaster/111733741786950083Note: only a single Internet Archive snapshot was made of that post.However if you View Source, you can find the entirety of that #queerAF post duplicated across a couple of invisible-to-the-user meta tags inside the raw HTML: "**TL;DR: Queer[.]AF will close on 2024-04-12** ‚Ä¶" [.] added to avoid linking to a dead domain.Note: such meta tags in js;dr pages were part of the motivation to specify metaformats.To be clear, the shutdown of queer(.)af was a tragedy and not the fault of the creators, administrators etc., but rather one of the unfortunate outcomes of using some ccTLDs, country-code top level domains, that risk sudden draconian rules, domain renewal price hikes, or other unpredictable risks due to the politics, turmoil, regime changes etc. of the countries that administrate such domains.Nearly the entirety of every Mastodon server, every post, every reply, is ephemeral.When a Mastodon server shuts down, all its posts disappear from the surface of the web, forever.Perhaps internet archeologists of the future will discover such dead permalinks, check the Internet Archive, find apparent desolation, and a few of them will be curious enough to use View Source tools to unearth parts of those posts, unintentionally preserved inside ceremonial meta tags next to dead scripts disconnected from databases and an empty shell of a body. All reply-contexts of and replies to such posts and conversations lost, like threads unraveled from an ancient tapestry, scattered to the winds.If you‚Äôre reading this post in your Mastodon reader, on either the website of your Mastodon account, or in a proprietary native client application, you should be able to click through, perhaps on the date-time stamp displayed to you, to view the original post on my website, where it is served in relatively simple declarative HTML + CSS with a bit of progressive enhancement script.Because I serve declarative content, my posts are both findable across a variety of services & search engines, and archived by the Internet Archive. Even if my site goes down, snapshots or archives will be viewable elsewhere, with nearly the same fidelity of viewing them directly on my site.This design for longevity is both deliberate, and the default for which the web was designed. It‚Äôs also one of the explicit principles in the IndieWeb community.If that resonates with you, if creating, writing, & building things that last matter to you, choose web tools, services, and software that support the persistence & longevity of your work.#persistentWeb #longWeb #LongNowThis is post 10 of #100PostsOfIndieWeb. #100Posts‚Üê https://tantek.com/2024/035/t2/indiewebcamp-brighton-tickets-available‚Üí https://tantek.com/2024/047/t1/indieweb-major-update-designPost glossary:API (Application Programming Interface) https://indieweb.org/APIBluesky https://indieweb.org/BlueskyBridgy https://brid.gy/Bridgy Fed https://fed.brid.gy/ccTLD (country-code top level domain) https://indieweb.org/ccTLDcurlable https://indieweb.org/curlabledeclarative web https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/webvision/full/#thedeclarativewebInternet Archive https://archive.org/js;dr (JavaScript required; Didn‚Äôt Read) https://tantek.com/2015/069/t1/js-dr-javascript-required-deadJSON https://indieweb.org/JSONlongevity https://indieweb.org/longevityMastodon https://indieweb.org/Mastodonmetaformats https://microformats.org/wiki/metaformatspermalink https://indieweb.org/permalinkprinciples in the IndieWeb community https://indieweb.org/principlesprogressive enhancement https://indieweb.org/progressive_enhancementreply https://indieweb.org/replyreply-context https://indieweb.org/reply-contextrobots.txt https://indieweb.org/robots_txtsocial media https://indieweb.org/social_mediasilo https://indieweb.org/siloView Source https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/view_source/index.html¬π https://chat.indieweb.org/2024-02-13#t1707845454695700¬≤ https://indieweb.org/site-deaths 13:18 on 2024-02-15 Twenty years and two days ago, @KevinMarks.com (@KevinMarks@xoxo.zone @KevinMarks) and I introduced #microformats in a conference presentation.I wrote a long retrospective last year: https://tantek.com/2023/047/t1/nineteen-years-microformatsSince that post nearly a year ago, here are the top three updates & interesting developments in microformats:1. Growing rel=me adoption for distributed verification (‚úÖ in Mastodon etc.) * Wikipedia: https://tantek.com/2023/139/t1/wikipedia-supports-indieweb-rel-me * Threads: https://tantek.com/2023/234/t1/threads-supports-indieweb-rel-me * omg.lol profile links by default: https://home.omg.lol/info/profile-items2. A proposal to merge h-review into h-entry, since reviews are in practice always entries with a bit more information: * https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/32 3. #metaformats adoptions, implementations, and iteration * There was growing practical interest in metaformats, so I updated the spec accordingly * A half dozen implementations shipped: https://indieweb.org/metaformats#IndieWeb_Examples * Active discussion for evolving metaformats to support more real world use-cases: https://github.com/microformats/metaformats/issuesHard to believe it‚Äôs been 20 years of iterating and evolving microformats, to #microformats2, growing adoption as #IndieWeb building blocks, distributed verification (those green checkmarks) in #Mastodon and across the #fediverse, and implementing metaformats parsing to standardize parsing various meta tags for link previews into equivalent microformats2.From last year‚Äôs activity, it‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs more use-cases, implementer interest, and community activity than ever.

Conversations bridged real world use-cases and technical details.It only took us five years after the first IndieWebCamp in Portland to recognize that the community had grown beyond the events, and had a clear need for a separate place for deep discussions of developer topics.As part of renaming the community from IndieWebCamp to IndieWeb‚Åµ, we created the #indieweb-dev (dev) channel for such technical topics like protocols, formats, tools, coding libraries, APIs, and any other acronyms or jargon.The community did a good job of keeping technical topics in the dev channel, and encouraging new folks in the main #indieweb channel who started technical conversations to continue them in the dev channel. Still, it was too easy for user-centric topics to veer into technical territory. It often felt more natural to continue a thread in the channel it started rather than break to another channel. There was also a need for regular community labor to nudge developer conversations to the developer chat channel.We had already started documenting IndieWeb related jargon‚Å∂ on the wiki and turned it into a MediaWiki Category so we could tag individual pages as jargon and have them automatically show-up in a list. Soon after, @aaronparecki.com (@aaronpk@aaronparecki.com) added a heuristic to the friendly channel bot Loqi to recognize when people started using jargon in the main IndieWeb chat channel and nudge‚Å∑ them to the development channel.Having Loqi do some of the gentle nudging has helped, though it‚Äòs still quite easy for even the experienced folks in the community to get drawn into a developer conversation on main as it were.We‚Äôve documented both a summary and lengthier descriptions of channel purposes‚Å∏ which help us remind each other, as well as provide a guide to newcomers.Both experienced community members and newcomers share much of the user-centric focus of the IndieWeb, the IndieWeb being for everyone‚Åπ, whether developer, hobbyist, or someone who wants an independent presence on the web without bothering with technical details. Whether some of us want to code or not, we all want to use our IndieWeb sites to express ourselves on the web, to use our sites instead of depending on social media silos. That shared purpose keeps us focused.It takes a village: eternal community vigilance is the price of staying user-centric and welcoming to newcomers.The ideas behind this post were originally shared in the IndieWeb meta chat channel.¬π‚Å∞This is post 8 of #100PostsOfIndieWeb. #100Posts‚Üê https://tantek.com/2024/033/t1/earthquake-sanfrancisco-shifted‚Üí https://tantek.com/2024/035/t2/indiewebcamp-brighton-tickets-availablePost glossary:development channel (indieweb-dev) https://indieweb.org/discuss#devDiscord https://indieweb.org/Discordformat https://indieweb.org/formatHacker News (HN) https://indieweb.org/Hacker_NewsIndieWeb https://indieweb.org/IndieWebIndieWebCamp https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCampIRC https://indieweb.org/IRCjargon https://indieweb.org/jargonLoqi https://indieweb.org/Loqimain IndieWeb chat channel (on main) https://indieweb.org/discuss#indiewebMatrix https://indieweb.org/Matrixmeta chat channel https://indieweb.org/discuss#metaMediaWiki Category https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Categoriesplumbing https://indieweb.org/plumbingprotocol https://indieweb.org/protocolReddit https://indieweb.org/Reddittools https://indieweb.org/toolsSlack https://indieweb.org/Slacksocial media silos https://indieweb.org/silos¬π https://www.paulgraham.com/trolls.html (2008 essay, HN still succumbed to trolling)¬≤ https://indieweb.org/discuss#Email¬≥ https://indieweb.org/make_what_you_need‚Å¥ https://indieweb.org/use_what_you_make‚Åµ https://indieweb.org/rename_to_IndieWeb‚Å∂ https://indieweb.org/jargon‚Å∑ https://indieweb.org/Category:jargon#Loqi_Nudge‚Å∏ https://indieweb.org/discuss#Chat_Channels_Purposes‚Åπ https://tantek.com/2024/026/t3/indieweb-for-everyone-internet-of-people¬π‚Å∞ https://chat.indieweb.org/meta/2024-01-22#t1705883690759800 15:05 on 2024-02-04 üëç to a comment on issue 844 of GitHub project ‚Äústandards-positions‚Äù 17:00 on 2024-02-02 likes @SutroTower‚Äôs reply 16:22 on 2024-02-02 I felt the #earthquake here in #SanFrancisco.

The social internet of people, a network of networks of people, connected peer-to-peer in human-scale groups, communities of locality and affinity.These peer-to-peer links should not require corporate platforms or other organizational intermediaries, nor should they require depending on developer intermediaries, nor server administrator intermediaries.This is the "indie" in IndieWeb, independence from intermediaries, not independence from people. Because the "web" in IndieWeb, is yes the Web of the World Wide Web, and it is also the Web of people.The "indie" in IndieWeb is also the independent agency to opt-into human-scale groups, opt-into peer-to-peer connections, opt-into communities, opt-into publics. As the POSSE page says: ‚ÄúFigure out how you want to fit into the network‚Äù. The "web" in IndieWeb is also an open acknowledgment and acceptance that regardless of what groups, connections, communities, and publics you opt-into, that they are all interconnected in a larger web, that even without connecting, you can accept and respect from a distance.The IndieWeb is for everyone, everyone who wants independence from organizations, independence of agency to associate, and who embraces the web of humans that want to interconnect, to communicate, to value and respect each other, whether one degree apart or thirty.¬πThis is post 5 of #100PostsOfIndieWeb. #100Posts‚Üê https://tantek.com/2024/023/t1/should-public-posts-flow-across-sites‚Üí https://tantek.com/2024/027/t1/indieweb-ideals-systems-swappablePost glossary:IndieWeb https://indieweb.org/POSSE https://indieweb.org/POSSEpublics https://indieweb.org/publics¬π https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/03/internet.email 22:40 on 2024-01-26 üëç to issue 709 of GitHub project ‚Äúbridgy-fed‚Äù 15:42 on 2024-01-26 üëç to issue 2463 of GitHub project ‚Äúelk‚Äù 15:41 on 2024-01-26 @snarfed.org posted a great overview of thoughtful (and sometimes heated) discussions across blogs and the #fediverse about how freely should ‚Äúpublic‚Äù posts & comments on the web flow across sites:‚ÄúModerate people, not code‚Äù (https://snarfed.org/2024-01-21_moderate-people-not-code)If you are designing or creating any kind of publishing or social features on the web, this post is for you.It touches on topics ranging from #contextCollapse to #federation to #moderation and everything in between.Does your choice of publishing tool set expectations about where your content might propagate, or whether it will be indexed by search engines? Should it?Do the limitations of your server (e.g. js;dr) imply limitations of where your posts go, or whether they can be searched or archived? Should they?When you post something publicly, are you truly posting it for a global audience for all time, or only for one or a few more limited #publics for an ephemerality?When you reply to a post, do you expect your reply to only be visible in the context you posted it, or do you expect it to travel alongside that post to anywhere it might propagate to?On the #IndieWeb, especially for public posts, some of these questions have easier and more obvious answers, because the intent of nearly all public IndieWeb posts is to interact across the web with other posts and sites, typically via the #Webmention protocol. However there are still questions.Are the expectations for a blog and blogging different from a social media site, whether a silo or an instance on a network?Is a personal website with posts still just a blog, or does it become something new when you start posting responses from your site, or receiving (e.g. via Webmention) and displaying responses from across the web to your posts on your site? Or is it now a ‚Äúsocial website‚Äù?If you have a social website, what is your responsibility for keeping it, well, social? Do you moderate Webmentions by default? Do you use the Vouch extension for some automatic moderation?Are #POSSE & #backfeed different from federation or are they the same thing from a user-perspective, with merely different names hinting at different implementations?Do you allow anyone from any site to respond or react to your posts? Or do you treat your social website like your home, and follow what I like to call a ‚Äúhouse party protocol‚Äù, only letting in those you know, and perhaps allowing them to bring a +1 or 2?I have many more questions. Each of these deserves thoughtful discussions, documentation of what different tools & services do today that we can try out, learn from, and use to make considered decisions when creating new things to post on and across websites.This is post 4 of #100PostsOfIndieWeb. #100Posts‚Üê https://tantek.com/2024/022/t1/indiewebcamp-brighton-planned‚Üí https://tantek.com/2024/026/t3/indieweb-for-everyone-internet-of-peoplePost glossary:backfeed https://indieweb.org/backfeedblog https://indieweb.org/blogblogging https://indieweb.org/bloggingcomments https://indieweb.org/commentscontext collapse https://indieweb.org/context_collapseephemerality https://indieweb.org/ephemeralityjs;dr https://indieweb.org/js;drmoderation https://indieweb.org/moderationPOSSE https://indieweb.org/POSSEposts https://indieweb.org/postspublics https://indieweb.org/publicsreply https://indieweb.org/replyVouch https://indieweb.org/VouchWebmention https://indieweb.org/Webmention 17:20 on 2024-01-23 The first IndieWebCamp of the year has been planned!üé™ IndieWebCamp Brightonüóì 2024-03-09‚Ä¶10üè¢ The Skiff, Brighton, Englandüéü Tickets available 2024-02-01!Event: https://events.indieweb.org/2024/03/indiewebcamp-brighton-2024-xRTP2hAZOvZdWiki: https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton Questions about #IndieWebCamp?

You can do it!I created a section on the #100Days page specifically for #100Posts projects:https://indieweb.org/100_days#100_posts_projectsAdd yourself and join in! 22:23 on 2024-01-02 Time to begin again: restarting my #100Days of #IndieWeb project for 2024, as a #100Posts of IndieWeb project, and congrats to the IndieWeb community on a fully completed 2023 IndieWeb Gift Calendar!Last year I completed 48 out of a planned 100 posts in my #100DaysOfIndieWeb project, for nearly 48 days (some days had multiple posts). Instead of resetting my goals accordingly, say down to 50, I‚Äôm going for 100 again, however, this time for 100 posts rather than 100 days, having learned that some days I find the time for multiple posts, and other days none at all.Looking back to the start of last year‚Äôs 100 Days project, it‚Äôs been one year since I encouraged everyone to own their own notes¬π. Since then many have started, restarted, or expanded their personal sites to do so. Some have switched from a #Twitter account to a #Mastodon (or other #fediverse) account as a stopgap for short-form status posts. A step in the right direction, yet also an opportunity to take the leap this year to fully own their identity and posts on the web.In 2023 Twitter also broke all existing API clients (including my website). I did not feel it was worth my time to re-apply for an API key and rebuild/retest any necessary code for my semi-automatic #POSSE publishing, not knowing when they might break things again (since there was no rational reason for them to have broken things in the first place).I manually POSSEd a few posts after that, yet from the lack of interactions, either Twitter‚Äôs feed algorithm¬≤ isn‚Äôt showing my posts, or people have largely left or stopped using Twitter. Either way, when your friends stop seeing your posts on a silo, there‚Äôs no need to spend any time POSSEing to it.On the positive side, the IndieWeb community really came together in 2023, shining brightly even through the darker days of December.We, the IndieWeb community (and some beyond!) provided a gift (or often multiple) to the rest of community for every single day of December 2023¬≥, the first time we successfully filled out the whole month since the 2018 IndieWeb Challenge‚Å¥, and only the second time ever in the seven years of the IndieWeb Challenge-turned-Gift-Calendar.By going through the various gifts (more than 2 per day on average!), there are many interesting numbers and patterns we could surface. That deserves its own post however, as does a summary of the 48 posts‚Åµ of my 2023 100 Days of IndieWeb attempt, so I‚Äôll end this post here.Happy New Year to all, with an especially well deserved congratulations to the IndieWeb community and everyone who contributed to the 2023 Gift Calendar. Well done! Let‚Äôs see what else we can create & share on our personal sites in 2024 and continue setting a higher bar for the independent web by showing instead of telling. #ShowDontTellThis is post 1 of #100PostsOfIndieWeb. #100Posts‚Üê ‚ú®‚Üí https://tantek.com/2024/003/t1/2023-indieweb-gift-calendar-numbersPost glossary:API https://indieweb.org/APIPOSSE https://indieweb.org/POSSEsilo https://indieweb.org/silo¬π https://tantek.com/2023/001/t1/own-your-notes¬≤ https://indieweb.org/algorithmic_feed¬≥ https://indieweb.org/2023-12-indieweb-gift-calendar‚Å¥ https://indieweb.org/2018-12-indieweb-challenge‚Åµ https://tantek.com/2023/365/t2/no-large-language-model-llm-used 19:30 on 2024-01-01 Hello Hi.
