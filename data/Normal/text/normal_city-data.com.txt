Our Tools Compare two cities Use our city comparison tool to analyze and compare two cities. Geographical and statistical data, demographics, current and historical values - itâ€™s all here. Making a decision on where to move is easier than ever! Advanced U.S. city search Find cities matching your requirements. Choose up to 10 criteria from our large database, set their desired ranges with easy-to-use visual controls and narrow the results using several available filters. Ideal Meeting Place This tool will help you find ideal meeting places between points, as well as the "travel radius" of a single point using different transportation modes. Unlike other tools that use simple approximations, the travel times in this tool are calculated using the road network analyzed with a routing algorithm. Travel Time Maps At City-Data, we gather location data for a wide variety of places. Using this data, we generate highly precise large-radius isochrone maps. We then utilize these isochrone maps to create user-friendly interactive maps that help you determine your travel time to the nearest location of your chosen category. Gasoline Usage Calculators for Trips Our Fuel Calculator allows you to determine the amount and cost of fuel for a trip, as well as compare both trip and yearly costs for two vehicles. House and Property Values We have collected assessment data for over 34 million properties around the United States. Not only can you find home and property values, but also the history of a property's value, land and building area, number of rooms, stories, additions, construction type, year of construction and more. You can compare all of these data on a single map, view photos and comments submitted by our users and easily find neighborhoods you want to live in! Restaurant Inspections and Reviews Find restaurants that you might enjoy, verify their compliance with state regulations, read reviews, browse restaurants in the neighborhood, and describe your experiences. We have inspection results and violations for over 700,000 restaurants, as well as ratings and reviews written by people who have previously visited them.
