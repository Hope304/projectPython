PETS/PoPETs is the premier venue for novel applied and/or theoretical research into the design, analysis, experimentation, or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies. Submitted papers undergo a journal-style reviewing process and accepted papers are published in the journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PoPETs). PoPETs, a scholarly, open access journal for timely research papers on privacy, has been established as a way to improve reviewing and publication quality while retaining the highly successful PETS community event. As of April, 2022, PoPETs is self-published. PoPETs does not have article processing charges (APCs) or article submission charges. Authors can submit papers to PoPETs four times a year, every three months on a predictable schedule. Authors are notified of the decisions two months after submission. The four submission deadlines for the 2024 volume of PoPETs are in May 2023, Aug 2023, Nov 2023, and Feb 2024. The call for papers provides more information for authors and a list of example topics in the scope of PoPETs.

Such papers must, however, be registered with an abstract by the usual deadline. All other papers than these major revision resubmissions must be submitted by the stated deadline, including papers submitted to and rejected from previous issues. To benefit from the two-week deadline extension, major revisions must be submitted to one of the two issues following the decision. Major revisions submitted to later issues are treated as new submissions, due by the regular deadline and possibly assigned to new reviewers. Past PETS Links to websites for previous PETS.
