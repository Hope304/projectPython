I get off work, open the door to our apartment, and you slur "hello." Your face struggles to make a smile. You never quite get there, and your eyes do not make it to mine.Kay HusnickPublished 4 days ago4 days ago in PoetsLoving the UnlovelyWe often talk about love as if it is something beyond our comprehension. Something divine or ethereal that cannot be touched or seen. We talk about it in hushed tones or scream about it, but usually when it feels distant. When we feel it slipping away.S. A. CrawfordPublished 5 days ago5 days ago in HumansWhat's in a Name?With a name like Mart Lindblast, you know there‚Äôs going to be trouble. No, you didn‚Äôt get that wrong. I said Mart, not Marty, not Martin, just Mart. You know, like K or Valu or Kwik-E. Mart. It‚Äôs just not the kind of name that lends itself to anything going right.Misty RaePublished a day agoa day ago in FictionCaff√® Sospeso Saw this as a post on Truck drivers for change Facebook - made me well up just a tad (AKA I balled my eyes out): There is a little coffee shop, where two people arrive and approached the counter. ‚ÄúFive coffees please. Two for us and three hanging.‚Äù They paid, they took their two coffees and left. I asked the waiter. "What‚Äôs this about hanging coffees?" ‚ÄúWait and you'll see." Some more people came in. Two girls asked for a coffee each, they paid & left. The following order was for seven coffees and it was made by three women - ‚Äòthree for them and four hanging coffees.‚Äô I was left wondering...what is the meaning of the hanging coffees, they leave. Then, a man dressed in worn clothes, who looks like he might be homeless, arrives at the counter and asks sincerely... ‚ÄúDo you have a coffee hanging?" ‚ÄúYes we do, sir.‚Äù They serve him a coffee.... I got my answer. People pay in advance for a coffee that will be served to whoever can't afford a hot drink. This tradition started in Naples. Amazingly, it has spread throughout the world‚Äôs cities and towns. It‚Äôs also possible to order not only "hanging coffees" but also a sandwich or a full low cost meal. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if we could all start doing this in the cities and towns where we live? Small kindnesses like this can impact so many lives, in ways we could never imagine. Maybe we should all try it.üòä‚ù§Ô∏èCelia in UnderlandPublished about 20 hours agoabout 20 hours ago in FictionSpring in WinterI never saw any white on the ground, unless you count the morning frost that disappeared before nine.

On February 21, 2024, our oldest child, Ava, did something so out-of-pocket, as the new saying goes, that it had Tony, my husband, and I staring at one another from across the table at 6 pm wondering, "Where's the child who was supposed to be just like us."Sarah GlassPublished 3 days ago3 days ago in HumorStars in My PocketsThe La-Z-boy chair was burgundy. Carefully selected to meet my mother‚Äôs needs of both comfort and stability, this chair had the added bonus of also matching the living room. There came a day when I couldn‚Äôt hug her for fear of hurting her, but I could lean into her by leaning into the chair‚Äôs cushions.Lydia StewartPublished 2 days ago2 days ago in FamiliesWhy I Stopped Watching Football and Became a Sports MonkI watched the Ice Bowl on December 31, 1967, between the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys. Every snap, every down, every tackle as the players rose ever more slowly throughout the game ‚Äî the freezing temperatures doing to their limbs what a freezer does to a pork chop.Joe LucaPublished 4 days ago4 days ago in Humor62 Flat Earth SocietyIt turned out the Earth really was flat. All of his data, which he knew to trust unconditionally and whose accuracy was beyond reproach, was tweaked. He had corrected for a decimal place here, a pixel there--Voila!

Philip Larkin was a poet with a gift for writing work that adheres quite tightly to pattern; and yet his skill causes the form almost to disappear, to melt into meaning. In our Abecedarian challenge, a formal structure is right out in front: the letters of the alphabet at the beginning of each line. Some of you landed neatly on each letter, accenting the form itself; other entries ‚Äî while keeping to our rubric ‚Äî worked to make the form flow into the poem. One‚Äôs no better than the other; it‚Äôs just fascinating for us to see the different ways in which you all approached this challenge.Vocal Curation TeamPublished 18 days ago18 days ago in ResourcesExplore CommunitiesJoin communities powered by creators who share your passions.Explore AllLoading...Find us on social mediaMiscellaneous linksExploreContactPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseSupport¬© 2024 Creatd, Inc.
