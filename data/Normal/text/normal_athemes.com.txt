They’re beautifully created, responsive and can easily be adapted to fit any business website. Customization options and plugins are using industry standards, which makes them reliable. The fact that they’re updated regularly and that the aThemes support forum is one of the best out there is very reassuring, both for us and our customers. Cedric Lenaers Founder/Owner - Office Tech I’ve been an aThemes user for several years by now. I use the service mainly to develop my own websites and although I am not a full pro designer the very well implemented code of the different themes and especially the very helpful support aThemes brings put me up and running in no time. Every year I renew my pro plan because it gives me confidence in the continuity of my sites and keeping them better as time passes. Thank you aThemes for your very nice development, support and, I can really say, friendship! Hector Barbone Multimedia Artist Having tried many other WordPress theme suppliers, besides the great designs and theme customisation the one thing that always brings me back to aThemes is the updates and support they offer, they’re in a league of their own!
