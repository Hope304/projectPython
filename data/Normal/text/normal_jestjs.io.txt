Well documented, well maintained, well good.Fast and safeBy ensuring your tests have unique global state, Jest can reliably run tests in parallel. To make things quick, Jest runs previously failed tests first and re-organizes runs based on how long test files take.Code coverageGenerate code coverage by adding the flag --coverage. No additional setup needed. Jest can collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files.Easy MockingJest uses a custom resolver for imports in your tests, making it simple to mock any object outside of your test‚Äôs scope. You can use mocked imports with the rich Mock Functions API to spy on function calls with readable test syntax.Great ExceptionsTests fail‚Äîwhen they do, Jest provides rich context why.
