In May 2019, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched two experiments with Huh’s organs-on-chips to the International Space Station. In orbit, a lung chip and bone marrow chip are being compared to Earth-bound counterparts to shed light on astronauts’ susceptibility to infection.

This produces an urgent need for innovative, leading-edge AI engineers who understand the principles of AI and how to apply them in a responsible and ethical way. George Pappas Elected to the National Academy of Engineering George Pappas, UPS Foundation Professor of Transportation in Electrical and Systems Engineering, has been elected to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) for his significant “contributions in analysis, synthesis, and control of safety-critical cyber-physical systems.” Pappas joins a distinguished group of 114 new members and 21 international members that comprise the NAE Class of 2024. Election to the NAE is one of the highest professional honors for an engineer, and Pappas’ induction places him among esteemed company. 2023 Year in Review In 2023, Penn Engineering pushed the boundaries of science and technology. Notably, Nader Engheta, H. Nedwill Ramsey Professor in Electrical and Systems Engineering, received the Benjamin Franklin Medal for creating the field of optical metatronics; Penn Engineers determined that humans can in fact detect AI-generated text; and Amy Gutmann Hall, the new home for data science at Penn, reached its final height. The School’s advancements in 2023 position Penn Engineering for even greater impact in 2024. Read More The Singh Center for Nanotechnology Turns 10 This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Singh Center for Nanotechnology, a building that exemplifies cutting-edge scientific research by virtue of its sleek geometry and meticulous attention to detail by all those involved in its development. Heralded by many as an architectural gem not only for the University of Pennsylvania but for Philadelphia, the iconic glass-clad, cantilevered 78,000 square-foot structure is nestled between the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter and David Rittenhouse Laboratory on the eastern edge of campus. It was also Penn’s first collaborative building between two schools: the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the School of Arts & Sciences.
