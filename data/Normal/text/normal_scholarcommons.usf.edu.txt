Research and scholarly output included here has been selected and deposited by the individual university departments and centers on campus. Digital Commons @ University of South Florida shares materials from faculty, student, community, and archival sources as part of a consolidated institutional repository. The collections include historical sources and scholarship from many cultures and time periods, and the content or its descriptions may be graphic or reflect biases. In some cases, they may conflict with strongly held cultural values, beliefs, or restrictions. We provide access to these materials to preserve the historical record, but we do not endorse the attitudes, prejudices, or behaviors found within them.
