The hub of this work, DataCollaboratives.org, is a resource on creating public value by exchanging data, collecting examples of data collaboratives from around the world, and providing information on how to develop and implement a data collaborative. The site, and the GovLab’s work on the topic in general, seeks to provide insight on how the responsible exchange of corporate data can improve people’s lives.

We want to explore when and under what circumstances engagement can result in lawmaking that is either more legitimate, more effective or both. Crowdlaw is an emerging field of practice that is comprised of lawyers, platform developers, lawyers, government employees and research scientists, among others including citizen advocates. GovLab plays a convening role to engage practitioners from around the world and has initiated a dialogue in order to identify case studies and pilots, assess impact and inspire greater innovation across political, government and civil society actors.
