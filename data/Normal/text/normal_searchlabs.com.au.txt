Hourly - access requiredLearn / BuyFAQs Shouldn't I just employ someone? I support employing a full time SEO 100% - I cost out at between $200 and $750 per hour, or $2000 per day at a minimum contract duration of 90 days. With SEO you get what you pay for, there are many cheap SEO consultants on the market, and there are many sites that have been 'burned' - which is not ideal. Our pricing structure allows you to pause and resume at any time. So we are only doing SEO whilst you are doing SEO. Start with the Edge Starter and go from there. What are the limitations in place? If you are a paying subscriber, you can add work items to the queue and I will work through them 1 by 1, I don't like wasting time, so I will submit the work item for your team to implement as soon as I can, and then I will wait for you to respond. How do I get my work items? I use Google Tasks, Google Drive and Google Sheets / Docs to both receive and provide work to subscribers. Once I provide them to you, we can iterate until it matches exactly what you want. I try to stay out of your hair, and I provide pretty logical instructions with validation. How long do I need to wait? I work quickly, generally you wont wait more than 2 days for the work items to be updated. However if the task is complex, it might take a little longer. Items are time boxed, and you get 'x' time blocks per month. Who are the team members in your team? For 99% of the work its Everhardt Strauss, I am the person that works with you, sure I use researchers to do some research, or if you want to head down the PPC route I will find someone who does PPC - but for the most part it is me. Can I put my account on hold? not Cancel, just pause it? Of course, I understand that with SEO, quite often a change takes a few months to show progress, or you only want to optimize 1 or 2 pages this month, thats fine. Our billing cycle runs through Xero, so on x day of every month an invoice goes out - if you pause 10 days in, then we prorata those days onto the next cycle when you start up. If however we feel that you are misusing this then - well, we end our happy fun relationship. What SEO programs do you use? I use as many tools as I can get my stickly little fingers on. I rely most heavily on Screaming Frog SEO Spider to review your site, then I use either Frase (First Wash) - then PoP (Second Wash) then CORA SEO (Third Wash) to provide technical and content briefs. I also make use of different TF-IDF balancing tools, as well as LSI extraction data sets. How do we work together? I don't really stress about how you request work, I am quite flexible on this one, I personally like using Google products - we are optimizing for their ecosystem after all - I am also happy to have the odd Zoom or Skype video call What if I don't agree with your recommendations? I am always happy to discuss the reasoning, most of my recommendations are search correlation based, so it is pure math, the art part is your side of the page - make the math looks good. I say what needs to be present, and you get to weave it into something beautiful. I only need you to do 1 thing? Awesome, I actually run into this quite often, it is the very reason we let you 'pause' the subscriptions. If you can't act on a brief now, then put your plan on hold and come back when you are ready for the next bit - this works better for organic search (as the organic search landscape may change). This is the 'cheapest in the long run' way of getting things done, of course if it's an emergency, then check out the bespoke item order form. If I don't like the service can I get a refund? Because we put time and effort and resources into every response - we here at Search Labs offer no refunds. But we can rework your requirement until it matches what you want.
