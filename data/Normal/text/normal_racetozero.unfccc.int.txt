A race against time and against ourselves. Against the dangerous idea that we can’t do this, that there is no way. Unlike most races, it won’t have one winner. In this race we all win, or we all lose. Winning it requires a radical, unprecedented level of collaboration, from all corners of our world. From our cities, businesses, regions and investors. From people everywhere. Together we’re racing for a better world. A zero carbon and resilient world. A healthier, safer, fairer world. A world of wellbeing, abundance and joy, where the air is fresher, our jobs are well-paid and dignified, and our future is clear. To get there we need to run fast, and get faster. We need more and more people to join the race, and right now. This is not about 2050, it’s about today. Together, we can do this. And we’re already on our way.
