DiSo Project DiSo Project Silo free living. Social networks are becoming more open, more interconnected, and more distributed. Many of us in the web creation world are embracing and promoting web standards — both client-side and server-side. Microformats, standard APIs, and open-source software are key building blocks of these technologies. This model can be described as having three sides: Information, Identity, and Interaction. Diso (dee • soh) is an initiative to facilitate the creation of open, non-proprietary and interoperable building blocks for the decentralized social web. Our first target is WordPress, bootstrapping on existing work and building out from there. So what does that mean? We’re building Wordpress plugins that implement or build on: microformats like XFN, hCard, XOXO - wp-contactlist, wp-profiles OpenID - wp-contactlist, wp-openid-server OAuth …and others Blogroll Chris Messina Stephen Paul Weber Steve Ivy Will Norris Diso - Distributed Diso Code Diso on Github Diso on Flickr Diso on Twitter Diso Wiki Archives 17 Feb 2010 » The Future Of DiSo 19 Oct 2009 » OpenID & Activity Streams 11 Jun 2008 » Social Network Interop Chat 04 Jun 2008 » XRDS-Simple On The Move 02 Jun 2008 » Interview with Chris Messina about DiSo by David Cohn 13 May 2008 » Chris and Will join Vidoop 25 Dec 2007 » Citizen Garden podcast on DiSo and identity in 2008 14 Dec 2007 » Chris on LikeItMatters podcast 11 Dec 2007 » WP OpenID move to DiSo repo now complete 07 Dec 2007 » Welcome to the Diso Project
