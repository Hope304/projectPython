GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection - GNU Project GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and D, as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,...). GCC was originally written as the compiler for the GNU operating system. The GNU system was developed to be 100% free software, free in the sense that it respects the user's freedom. We strive to provide regular, high quality releases, which we want to work well on a variety of native and cross targets (including GNU/Linux), and encourage everyone to contribute changes or help testing GCC. Our sources are readily and freely available via Git and weekly snapshots. Major decisions about GCC are made by the steering committee, guided by the mission statement.
