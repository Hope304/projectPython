Resolve a DOI Name VISIT DOI.ORG Resolve a DOI Name Type or paste a known DOI name exactly—including its prefix and suffix—into the text box below and then ‘submit’ to resolve it. DOIs include a prefix (prefixes always start with 10.) and a suffix, separated by a forward slash (/). Prefacing the DOI with doi.org/ will turn it into an actionable link, for example, https://doi.org/10.1109/5.771073. Clicking that link will ‘resolve’ it, i.e. redirect to the latest information about the object it identifies, even if the object changes or moves. Send questions or comments to doi-help@doi.org.
