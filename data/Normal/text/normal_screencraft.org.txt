I am in San Francisco and I thought the only way to get out there is to start entering contests and see what happens. And because of ScreenCraft, an opportunity did knock. They put me in touch with a manager, like he really understood what I was trying to do with my stories. ScreenCraft put me in touch with a producer and we ended up taking it to a major studio, who expressed interest in my script, which is beyond my wildest imagination. Eventually, everybody has some opportunity, some luck and you have to be ready, and I think ScreenCraft really helped me be ready."See MoreAlex BoydHired on CW‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù"People really do make it in this industry,‚Äù says screenwriter Alex Boyd. ‚ÄúWhen I moved to LA to start my writing career, I knew zero people in the industry.

Even when I wrote something I was proud of, I often felt like it was wasting away on my hard drive with nobody to read.‚ÄùIn 2021, Alex entered ScreenCraft‚Äôs TV Pilot competition. He won. ‚ÄúI had been submitting to competitions for years now with some success, but I was particularly excited to enter ScreenCraft because of the genre-specific categories," he says.
