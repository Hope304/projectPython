Conservation Status Percentages are calculated based on 11,017 species in Birds of the World. Data provided by IUCN (2023) Red List. More information The IUCN (2023) Red List is based on a different taxonomy than Birds of the World. As such, we can only display conservation status for taxa where the two taxonomies match at the species level. For all unmatched taxa, the conservation status is "Unknown". Hide Conservation status 0% 100% Least Concern LC 71.3% Near Threatened NT 7.9% Vulnerable VU 6.2% Endangered EN 3.5% Critically Endangered CR 2% Extinct in the Wild EW 0.05% Extinct EX 1.4% Not Evaluated NE 0% Data Deficient DD 0.34% Unknown 7.4% About Birds of the World Birds of the World is a powerful resource that brings deep, scholarly content from four celebrated works of ornithology into a single platform where biologists and birders can find comprehensive life history information on birds.
