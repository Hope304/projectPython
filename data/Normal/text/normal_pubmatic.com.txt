DAVIDE COSTANTINOHEAD OF DIGITAL HUBHAVAS MEDIA GROUP ITALY Learn How PubMatic and Havas Exceed Viewability Target with New Cookieless Targeting Solution Finding new, more efficient ways to activate data is vital to the success of our client’s campaigns. PubMatic’s Ad Solutions team helped us to explore new ways to activate data without being reliant on the DSP. By using PubMatic’s Connect we were able to get our data partners to pass the usual segments into the platform to be targeted via a deal ID creating a new supply chain with a trusted partner where the data now sits closer to the source of the inventory. By being closer to the inventory, we were able to deliver the activity without sacrificing performance and, in most cases, drive better results.
