We Impact Lives Jeff Dawson "Thank you to the National Kidney Foundation for education, preparation and support aiding me to communicate my story and find a living donor. I am forever grateful for the insight and tools provided." Alan Camuto "My kidney function came down to 9%. It was a shock. I had just gotten married. We had plans. The information on this website and everything I’d learned over the years is what got me through this." Tracy McKibben "Kidney disease impacts people’s lives in a way that is unimaginable. We didn’t know that it was an option to donate. It didn’t change much for me, but it changed so much for the person that I gave the kidney to."
