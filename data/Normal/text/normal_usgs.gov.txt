The USGS has partnered with NASA to help plan and complete missions by studying how geologic processes work across the solar system, participating in rover missions, and training astronauts to return to the Moon. Our scientists make geologic maps of other planetary bodies, investigate minerals and rocks, use computer modeling to simulate planetary processes, and process mission data so other scientists can use it in their work.
