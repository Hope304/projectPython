They truly helped me sustain my independent status.” Ingrid Michaelson Solo pop artist “CD Baby’s website and DIY blog have provided me with all the information I needed to release three consecutive No. 1 Billboard albums without any major label support.” Paul Cardall Pianist “CD Baby makes it super easy to drop a worldwide release on your own schedule. The user interface is simple and the terms are great. The best part is when you see an email with the sales statement. Then you know the music is making an impact on people.” Aloe Blacc Singer-songwriter, record producer “CD Baby has been our trusted distribution partner for many years. They are professional, helpful and offer great service to artists and consumers alike. We are very happy to be in business with them.” Two Steps from Hell Motion picture music composers O que os artistas estão dizendo sobre a CD Baby “Em 2015 eu estava começando e conheci a CD Baby, de cara foi uma grande facilitadora para mim, desde lá, lançamos um disco, um EP e agora novos Singles virão até o fim do ano. Tudo de forma simples, prática e organizada. Tenho muito carinho pela plataforma, pois sou muito bem atendida pela equipe sempre muito solícita e atenta as minhas demandas e ideais. Cada artista tem trabalhos, expectativas e fluxos de produção bastante diferentes uns dos outros, e sinto que a plataforma consegue conduzir essa parte quase que com um atendimento personalizado. É uma parceria que tem dado super certo, já comemoramos várias conquistas, e tenho certeza que ainda colheremos muitos outros frutos juntos.” Lia Paris Artista solo “Meus álbuns solo são independentes e distribuindo pela CD Baby estão disponíveis em todos os serviços de download e streaming ao lado dos grandes artistas e bandas como o Megadeth.
