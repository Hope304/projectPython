The EIG is not only an extension of the work already underway via the ACM SIG Governing Board and the ACM Publications Board, but supports developers of future tools, technologies, methodologies and techniques; outreaches into communities which may not feel/be included; disseminates best practice and training resources interested parties; and, supports and advises in the practical implementation of our work at conferences, journals, and other venues. Further, by gathering and disseminating the collective knowledge obtained by the different SIGs in their reproducibility efforts we can capitalize on the work already invested in ACM's Reproducibility and Replicability community and ensure the legacy of the effort, within the ACM and externally to other organizations.
