Easily print from any device, anytime Printing is a boring part of IT because it should be, because it should “just work”. PaperCut empowers you to make printing easy again for your end users, whether they’re printing from a BYOD or mobile device, and makes your life easy by auto-deploying print drivers. We’ve got truckloads more on offer, from industry-leading third-party integrations to easy tap-and-release Find-Me printing. WHAT WAS ON YOUR LAST UNCOLLECTED PRINTOUT? Secure all documents before, during, and after printing Organizations spend a fortune protecting their digital data but a leak could be as simple as leaving a document on the printer. Control device access, implement secure print release or even digitally sign and watermark your print jobs to take security to a new level. WAS YOUR LAST JOB DOUBLE-SIDED? Shrink your footprint and your bills Waste reduction and cost control is not about using a stick, it’s about subtly changing user behavior (a stick may help!). PaperCut is packed full of features such as encouraging duplex printing, implementing reasonable usage quotas, and full pay-for-print and print chargeback policies. Did you know that when we surveyed our customers, we found that implementing just one feature, like secure print release, helped them save as much as 15%.
