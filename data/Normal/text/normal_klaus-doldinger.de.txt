New work in a freshly mastered sound "The First 50 Years of Passport" has been setting up for 50 years now"Crime scene" topic, which is steadily broadcast before and after each episode of the ARD crime series, in the collective memory again and again, at least sketchy.But if you listen to the famous piece again in full enthusiasts, you not only recognize an excellent production and carefully chosen instrumentation.The striking "crime scene" melody introduction stands for almost everything that Doldinger has formulated with his band Passport since 1970.His numerous bandmates have taken and found over the past half century.Over 5000 concerts that Passport almost played on all continents on earth have left their mark on the great work of the important volume. A considerable cross -section has become "The First 50 Years of Passport" - carefully from the "Master and Mentor", as Klaus DoldingerRespectfully referred to by Udo Lindenberg.Newly mastered, the pieces shine more than ever and take the listener on a more intensive journey into the history of Passport.https: //klaus-doldinger.com#music 2019-06-14 16:51:20 MUSIC The first 50 years of passportthe first 50 years of passport.
