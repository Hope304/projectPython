Instead of having us come up with all the definitions of how the app should function, we focused instead on the end result we wanted to see each of the user stories be able to tell. Then, we worked backward from there on features and functionality. If we hadn’t have done that step, we wouldn’t have had outside-the-box thinking, and our app would be just a carbon-copy of our competitors’.” Kris Fulgham Owner, CayCan Safety Consulting Ltd.
