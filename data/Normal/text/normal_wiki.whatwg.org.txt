WHATWG Wiki A user account is required in order to edit this wiki, but we've had to disable public user registrations due to spam. To request an account, ask an autoconfirmed user on Chat (such as one of these permanent autoconfirmed members). Main Page From WHATWG Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Welcome to the WHATWG Wiki! You can be a part of our community, making proposals for web standards. This wiki is made available for you for drafting proposals, for writing essays, for keeping track of WHATWG spec-related issues, and so forth. Before you begin, you may wish to read our contribution guidelines. Once you are an autoconfirmed user, you may create new user accounts, by request. Note that although we still use the wiki for some things, much activity these days is on GitHub, and so the wiki pages can be rather historical.
