I'm Karen; it’s lovely to see you here. I was born in South Africa, but I've lived all over the world, latterly calling North Yorkshire my home where I lived for many years before moving to SW France, although I'm now living in the Lincolnshire Wolds, a designated area of outstanding natural beauty, in an old Victorian cottage. I am a freelance food and travel writer, as well as a food stylist, and recipe developer, with a passion for art, travel, books, photography, seasonal food and especially cheese and wine. Please do get in contact with me if you have any questions about my work or commissioning me.
