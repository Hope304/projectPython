Polkadot: Web3 Interoperability | Decentralized BlockchainSkip to main contentEcosystemFeaturesDevelopmentAboutUse PolkadotThe blockspace ecosystem for boundless innovationThe blockspace ecosystem for boundless innovationGet your Web3 ideas to market fast with economics that work for youLearn about blockspaceLearn about blockspaceTrue interoperabilityPolkadot enables cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. Connecting to Polkadot gives you the ability to interoperate with a wide variety of blockchains in the Polkadot network.Economic & transactional scalabilityPolkadot provides unprecedented economic scalability by enabling a common set of validators to secure multiple blockchains. Polkadot provides transactional scalability by spreading transactions across multiple parallel blockchains.Easy blockchain innovationCreate a custom blockchain in minutes using the Substrate↗ framework. Connect your chain to Polkadot and get interoperability and security from day one. This ease of development helps Polkadot’s network grow.High energy efficiencyPolkadot consumes a small fraction of the energy used by conventional blockchains thanks to its next-generation nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) model. Using the equivalent of ~6.6 US households worth of energy per year, Polkadot has the lowest carbon footprint↗ among proof-of-stake protocols analyzed in recent research↗.Security for everyonePolkadot's novel data availability and validity scheme allows chains to interact with each other in a meaningful way. Chains remain independent in their governance, but united in their security.User-driven governancePolkadot has a sophisticated governance system where all stakeholders have a voice. Network upgrades are coordinated on-chain and enacted autonomously and without forking the network, ensuring that Polkadot’s development remains future-proof and community-driven.Learn more about Polkadot’s technologyDiscover PolkadotPowering the Polkadot networkThe DOT token serves three distinct purposes: governance over the network, staking and bonding.GovernancePolkadot token holders have complete control over the protocol. All privileges, which on other platforms are exclusive to miners will be given to the Relay Chain participants (DOT holders), including managing exceptional events such as protocol upgrades and fixes.StakingToken holders keep the network secure and collect rewards by staking DOT. Polkadot’s advanced staking system is designed for maximum decentralization and fair representation, rewarding good actors and punishing bad actors to ensure network security.BondingNew parachains are added by bonding tokens. Outdated or non-useful parachains are removed by removing bonded tokens. This is a form of proof of stake.Learn more about DOT and stakingDiscover DOTLearn stakingAn open-source protocol built for everyonePolkadot is an open-source project founded by the Web3 Foundation↗.Web3 Foundation has commissioned five teams and over 100 developers to build Polkadot, including:ChainSafeParity TechnologiesPolkadot JSSoramitsuFounded by some of the blockchain industry’s foremost buildersLearn moreFrom the blogDevelopersThe Polkadot Alpha Program: A New Era of Collaborative BuildingThe Polkadot Alpha Program is a new initiative the helps lower entry barriers for teams eager to build in the ecosystem.
