It’s truly mind blowing to be going to a place like Stanford at a time when so much is happening..."Meet Tamish Puluppadi at the intersection of music and technology CS Degree ProgramsOur main educational goal is to prepare students for a rapidly changing world. Undergraduate students have the option of declaring a Bachelor of Science or a Minor in Computer Science. Graduate students have the opportunity to pursue a Master's or PhD degree in Computer Science. The Master's degree is a terminal professional degree. The PhD is for those who desire a research or teaching career. A Gateway to Opportunity & InnovationStanford Computer Science cultivates an expansive range of research opportunities and a renowned group of faculty. Here, discoveries that impact the world spring from the diverse perspectives and life experiences of our community of students, faculty, and staff. Passion + Inspiration Our Research & Impact The CS Department is a center for research and education, discovering new frontiers in AI, robotics, scientific computing and more.More About CS Research Scientific Discovery Our Faculty Stanford CS faculty members strive to solve the world's most pressing problems, working in conjunction with other leaders across multiple fields.
