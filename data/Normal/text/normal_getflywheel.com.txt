WordPress hosting FAQ for agencies and freelancers As many of the answers as we could compile! What does managed WordPress hosting mean? As a managed WordPress host, Flywheel is going to take care of a bunch of the technical nitty-gritty stuff, so you can get back to doing what you love and growing your business. Here are the main benefits of a true managed WordPress host like Flywheel: Managed caching and performance: We handle caching for you at the server level, using super fast servers to begin with, and even work individually with our customers to further optimize their sites for the best performance. No plugins needed! Managed security: We proactively scan and block malware and hacking attempts. We do all of this at the server level, without the need for any plugins or configuration on the part of the customer. And in the unlikely event that your site is hacked, we’ll fix it for you, free of charge. Managed software updates: We’ll work with you to make sure your site is always running the latest and greatest WordPress software. Expert WordPress support: Our team of WordPress experts goes above and beyond what nearly any other managed hosting company will help out with. From “hey, I need help, I have a serious problem!“, to “can you recommend a plugin for XYZ,” we’re here to help. Those are the core pieces of what it means to be a true managed WordPress hosting provider. If you have any questions, let us know! How is Flywheel different from other managed WordPress hosting companies? There are a number of things that make Flywheel stand out from other companies in the WordPress hosting industry. Here’s a nice, long list: We ONLY host WordPress sites. We specialize in WordPress and it’s all we do, day in and day out. Our servers are tuned for WordPress, our support team is staffed with WordPress experts, and our resources are all WordPress-oriented. Free migrations, free SSL, free demo sites, free malware cleanup. Your Flywheel plan comes with a bunch of brilliant perks for the low, low price of zero cents. Our plans start at just $13. Most managed WordPress hosts start at much more than that! We have a TON of workflow tools for agencies, designers, and developers. Flywheel is so much more than a hosting company. From billing transfer to collaboration tools, we have a suite of fantastic features that are designed to make your clients happier and your life easier. Dedicated resources. You aren’t sharing your server space with anyone else, leading to better performance and security. 99.9% uptime. It really, truly can’t get much better than that! Support. Our team is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week via live chat. They’re all experts in the industry, so they can help with everything from an odd error to a recommendation for a plugin.
