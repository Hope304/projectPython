The Typekit Blog | Time for a change: Typekit has become Adobe Fonts Adobe Typekit Blog Blog Menu Time for a change: Typekit has become Adobe Fonts Today we’re changing our name from Typekit to Adobe Fonts, with the goal of incorporating our service more fully into Creative Cloud and reaching the broader Adobe audience in new ways. That means we’ll be posting over on the Adobe blog network from here on out. For news and updates (and the full story about what’s changing today), please visit the Typography channel. While it won’t see any more updates, this blog will continue to live here as a reference. We’re already thinking about new ways to showcase the unusually concentrated expertise in web fonts and typography that we have here on the team. You’ll see a lot of it emerging in the Typography channel as we continue to add fonts to the library and build new tools for using type intelligently in Adobe applications. We’re excited about what’s ahead. Whether you’ve just found this blog or have been subscribed for years, thank you for reading. Keep up with our new Twitter handle @AdobeFonts, and we hope to see you over in our new digs. Sally Kerrigan · October 15, 2018 · Announcements Sally Kerrigan Content Editor at Typekit.
