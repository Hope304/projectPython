Johannes Wetekam et al. used a noninvasive technique to measure C. perspicillata auditory brainstem responses in their investigation of the role of the brainstem in deviance detection, or the process of detecting sounds that deviate from general expectations of what an environment should sound like. See the article by Wetekam et al. for more information. Cover image: Julio Hechavarria.
