Rhino is the most versatile of all 3D modelers, a jack-of-all-trades used in many industries‚Ä¶ Architects & Engineers Marine Designers Jewelers Landscape Designers Educators ‚Ä¶just to name a few. No matter the scale, whenever a model needs to get from your screen to a real, built object, you will find Rhino. "I‚Äôve been using Rhino for 20 years. It‚Äôs the backbone of my work. Many art departments use Rhino on the bigger films requiring complex designs." Scott Schneider, Film Designer "Grasshopper for Rhino is one of the best platforms for computational design. It's easy to use for beginners, and the depth of possibilities make it an incredibly customizable framework for advanced users." Jose Luis Garc√≠a del Castillo y L√≥pez, ParametricCamp "For last 10 years, Rhino has been my development tool for designing kitesurfing equipment: boards, bindings, control systems. More recently, for kite design, I've developed a 100% parametric engine in Grasshopper to automate my workflow." Dave Kay, Kiteboard Shaper Grasshopper Grasshopper is a visual programming environment tightly integrated with Rhino‚Äôs 3D modeling tools. Grasshopper requires no knowledge of programming or scripting, but still allows designers to build generative forms from the simple to the awe-inspiring. Grasshopper also has a very rich add-on library. Grasshopper Community Rhino‚Äôs Ecosystem food4Rhino +1500 apps/resources for Rhino and Grasshopper.
