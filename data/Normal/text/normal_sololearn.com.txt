It was Sololearn. I thought, "Neat, learning on your mobile phone!" I was just starting to learn to code and I made all the usual beginner mistakes, so I gave Sololearn a try. Through Sololearn, I have found many learners who have helped me grow. I have met teachers, engineers, developers, data scientists, and more amazing people. The learning environment created by Sololearn served as a catalyst for me to pick up good practices, which go beyond learning and into the workplace."
