The water level on the left side is seen to be lowered, butthe water level on the right does not change. Consider the following student dialogue: Student 1: “The pressure at point F must now be higher than atmospheric pressure because the water there is being pushed up against the stopper.” Student 2: “I think that the pressure at point E must be the same as at point A because they are at the same level. These points are both at atmospheric pressure. So the pressure at point F is lower than atmospheric pressure because know that pressure gets less as you go up.” Student 3: “But water is more dense than air so the pressure at F cannot be less than atmospheric pressure.” With which student(s), if any, do you agree?Chapter 1.2, Problem 1jT: Description of Motion: Initially move away from the detector; maintain a constant negative acceleration.Chapter 1.2, Problem 1hT: Description of Motion: Move toward the detector with decreasing speed, then just as you have come to rest, move away, from the detector with increasing speed.Chapter 23.2, Problem 4TH: The figure at right has several errors.

It should also have the following methods: set_name This method assigns a value to the _ _name field. set_animal_type This method assigns a value to the _ _animal_type field. set_age This method assigns a value to the _ _age field. get_name This method returns the value of the _ _name field. get_animal_type This method returns the value of the _ _animal_type field. get_age This method returns the value of the _ _age field. Once you have written the class, write a program that creates an object of the class and prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of his or her pet. This data should be stored as the objects attributes. Use the object's accessor methods to retrieve the pets name, type, and age and display this data on the screen.Chapter 4, Problem 4PE: Distance Traveled The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows: distance = speed x time For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles. Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and the number of hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period.

Before each card is shown you are to guess which card it will be. After making your guess, you are told whether or not your guess is correct but not which card was turned over. It turns out that the strategy that maximizes the expected number of correct guesses fixes a permutation of the n cards, say 1, 2,. . ., n, and then continually guesses 1 until it is correct, then continually guesses 2 until either it is correct or all cards have been turned over, and then continuality guesses 3, and so on. Let G denote the number of correct guesses yielded by this strategy. Determine P(G=k) Hint: In order for C to be at least k what must be the order of cards 1,â€¦,k.Chapter 3, Problem 3.83P: In a certain contest, the players are of equal skill and the probability is 12 that a specified one of the two contestants will be the victor, in a group of 2n players, the players are paired off against each other at random. The 2n1 winners are again paired off randomly, and so on, until a single winner remains. Consider two specified contestant, A and B, and define the events Ai,in,E by Ai: A plays in exactly i contests E: A and B never play each other Find P(Ai),i=1,...,n. Find P(E). Let Pn=P(E).

The class constructor should accept the amount of the savings accounts starting balance. The class should also have methods for subtracting the amount of a withdrawal, adding the amount of a deposit, and adding the amount of monthly interest to the balance. The monthly interest rate is the annual interest rate divided by twelve. To add the monthly interest to the balance, multiply the monthly interest rate by the balance, and add the result to the balance. Test the class in a program that calculates the balance of a savings account at the end of a period of time. It should ask the user for the annual interest rate, the starting balance, and the number of months that have passed since the account was established. A loop should then iterate once for every month, performing the following: a. Ask the user for the amount deposited into the account during the month. Use the class method to add this amount to the account balance. b. Ask the user for the amount withdrawn from the account during the month. Use the class method to subtract this amount from the account balance. c. Use the class method to calculate the monthly interest. After the last iteration, the program should display the ending balance, the total amount of deposits, the total amount of withdrawals, and the total interest earned.Chapter 6, Problem 13PC: Deposit and Withdrawal Files Use Notepad or another text editor to create a text file named Deposits.txt. The file should contain the following numbers, one per line: 100.00 124.00 78.92 37.55 Next, create a text file named Withdrawals.txt. The file should contain the following numbers, one per line: 29.88 110.00 27.52 50.00 12.90 The numbers in the Deposits.txt file are the amounts of deposits that were made to a savings account during the month, and the numbers in the Withdrawals.txt file are the amounts of withdrawals that were made during the month. Write a program that creates an instance of the SavingsAccount class that you wrote in Programming Challenge 12. The starting balance for the object is 500.00. The program should read the values from the Deposits.txt file and use the objects method to add them to the account balance. The program should read the values from the Withdrawals.txt file and use the objects method to subtract them from the account balance. The program should call the class method to calculate the monthly interest, and then display the ending balance and the total interest earned.Chapter 5, Problem 2PC: Retail Price Calculator Write a program that asks the user to enter an items wholesale cost and its markup percentage. It should then display the items retail price. For example: If an items wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 100 percent, then the items retail price is 10.00. If an items wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 50 percent, then the items retail price is 7.50. The program should have a method named calculateRetail that receives the wholesale cost and the markup percentage as arguments, and returns the retail price of the item.Chapter 5, Problem 3PC: Rectangle AreaComplete the Program If you have downloaded the books source code from www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis, you will find a partially written program named AreaRectangle.java in this chapters source code folder. Your job is to complete the program. When it is complete, the program will ask the user to enter the width and length of a rectangle, and then display the rectangles area. The program calls the following methods, which have not been written: getLengthThis method should ask the user to enter the rectangles length, and then return that value as a double. getWidthThis method should ask the user to enter the rectangles width, and then return that value as a double. getAreaThis method should accept the rectangles length and width as arguments, and return the rectangles area. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. displayDataThis method should accept the rectangles length, width, and area as arguments, and display them in an appropriate message on the screen.Chapter 3, Problem 17PC: Wi-Fi Diagnostic Tree Figure 3-23 shows a simplified flowchart for troubleshooting a bad Wi-Fi connection.
