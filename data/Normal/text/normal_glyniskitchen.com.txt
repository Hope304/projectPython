She began using her parents’ kitchen to prepare meals and bake all sorts of desserts by the time she was 10 years old. During college she would make waffles, pancakes, crêpes, and French toast for her friends. After college Albright and her junior high school sweetheart, Gerald were married.

For over two decades, she freely shared her waffles and other foods with friends who visited.
