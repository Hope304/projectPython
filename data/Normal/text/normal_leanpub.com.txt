Lean Publishing is the act of publishing an in-progress book using lightweight tools and many iterations to get reader feedback, pivot until you have the right book and build traction once you do. You can learn more about Lean Publishing in The Lean Publishing Manifesto, or watch the Tools of Change conference talk about it. There's even a book about these ideas, which still guide us today.Leanpub is a magical typewriter for authors: just write in plain text, and to preview or publish your ebook, just click a button. On Leanpub, you can write in Markdown and generate your ebook with one click. (Markdown is really easy: everything you need to know is in the template we set up for you when you create a new book.)Now, if you have completed a book already or if you have a writing workflow you prefer, you can also just upload your own PDF or EPUB files and click a button to publish them.Whether you're writing in Markdown or uploading PDF and EPUB files, Leanpub is the best place to write, publish and sell in-progress and completed ebooks, with coupons, variable pricing, bundles and more. Besides how easy we make everything and the excellent support we provide, the other reason authors love Leanpub is our 80% royalty rate.We pay 80% royalties. That's not a typo: you earn $16 on a $20 sale. If we sell 5000 copies of your book for $20, you'll earn $80,000. Yes, some authors have already earned much more than that on Leanpub. In fact, authors have earned over $13 million USD writing, publishing and selling on Leanpub.Finally, Leanpub also supports publishing online courses, using the same Lean Publishing approach and Markdown-based workflow that we use for ebooks, and paying the same 80% royalties! To learn more, just create a course: the new course will contain a template which shows you how to get started.Learn About LeanpubCreate a Book or CourseThe ShelfClean Code Principles And PatternsPetri SilenLearning how to learn: Mental modelsNeil KeleherThe Ultimate Guide to Outsourcing Your AuthEdited by Dan MooreTHE ART OF LEADERSHIPErik SchönClean Code Principles And PatternsPetri SilenLearning how to learn: Mental modelsNeil KeleherThe Ultimate Guide to Outsourcing Your AuthEdited by Dan MooreTHE ART OF LEADERSHIPErik SchönFeatured Frontmatter Podcast InterviewJeff SutherlandJeff Sutherland, Author of First Principles in Scrum: Teams That Finish Early Accelerate FasterJeff Sutherland - Jeff is the author of the Leanpub book First Principles in Scrum: Teams That Finish Early Accelerate Faster.
