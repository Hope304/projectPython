In a lot of ways, the E-M5 III is essentially an E-M1 II crammed into an even smaller, lighter package, which is quite impressive. With an updated sensor, faster processor, phase-detect AF, better image stabilization and more, the compact E-M5 Mark III offers quite a bit of performance and quality in a form factor that won't weigh you down, nor hit too hard on the wallet. Read more in our in-depth Olympus E-M5 III review! Canon EOS RP Review 26.2mp | 4.4x | $999 Big sensor, small price point. The compact EOS RP is Canon's second full-frame mirrorless camera, and while it lacks some bells and whistles, the RP lowers the barrier of entry into the full-frame world in a big way. The Canon RP is one of, if not the most, affordable full-frame cameras on the market today, selling right at $999. With a 26MP sensor, Dual Pixel CMOS AF, 4K video recording and a highly portable design, the little EOS RP is an amazing bang-for-your-buck camera. If you're thinking of making the leap into full-frame without busting your budget, be sure to check out our in-depth Canon EOS RP review for all the details! Panasonic S1R Review 47.3mp | 4.4x | $3,698 Panasonic jumps into the fray with their first full-frame mirrorless camera, and the results are very impressive. The new Panasonic S1R is a powerful, DSLR-styled mirrorless camera with a fantastic, high-res 47MP full-frame sensor, built-in IBIS, 4Kp60 video and weather-sealing. The S1R proves to be an excellent pro-level camera for landscape, architectural, portrait and (in some cases) wildlife photographers who want high-quality, high-resolution image-making performance. The DFD-based AF system and a slower continuous burst speeds make it less ideal for fast action, yet it's still a fairly responsive camera given its resolution. For all the new details on Panasonic's high-resolution full-frame mirrorless camera, head over to our Panasonic S1R review! Canon 90D Review 32.5mp | 7.5x | $1,199 At first glance, the Canon 90D just looks like a classic Canon DSLR. It offers comfortable ergonomics, great durability, lots of physical controls, and familiarity and user-customization, plus compatibility with a veritable boatload of Canon EF lenses. Under the hood, however, there are lots of improvements over the previous model, particularly with image resolution, AF, burst shooting and video recording. Sure the Canon 90D has some drawbacks, but it's still capable of taking great photos, shooting pleasing high-res video, and has excellent AF and performance. For all the details, see our in-depth Canon 90D review! Sony A7R IV Review 61.0mp | Non-Zoom | $2,998 The Sony A7R IV is a thoroughly impressive camera. Its high-res 61MP sensor captures images with incredible detail. With swift burst shooting, top-notch high ISO performance, fast AF, Real-Time Eye AF tracking, 4Kp30 video and in-body image stabilization, the Sony A7R IV is way more versatile that one might think. The image files, however, are cumbersome, and the resolution is likely more than what most people need. And at around $3500 body-only, the A7R IV certainly isn't cheap. However, given all that it offers, it's hard not to recommend the A7R IV if you have the cash and need the resolving power. Read more in our in-depth Sony A7R IV review! Panasonic G95 Review 20.3mp | 5.0x | $698 Borrowing the higher-res 20MP sensor from the G9, more advanced video features from the GH5 and featuring an updated body design, the refreshed Panasonic G95 answers the call for a versatile and capable hybrid mirrorless camera designed for stills and video shooters alike. The G95 offers excellent image quality, fast performance, excellent video, and robust weather sealing, all at a reasonable price point. The G95 hits a nice sweet spot for enthusiasts and intermediate-level creators looking for a well-rounded, multimedia-focused camera that doesn't break the bank. Read more in our in-depth Panasonic G95 review! Panasonic LX100 II Review 17.0mp | 3.1x | $798 It might look a lot like its predecessor, but the Panasonic LX100 II offers a significant upgrade in image quality and generous performance in a take-anywhere body that'll slip easily into your coat pocket. It's perhaps not the best choice for video shooters, but still imaging fans will find lots to love, whether they prefer shooting raw or JPEG. And despite a compact body, there are generous controls and plenty of customization options to tune it to your tastes. Read on and find out if it's for you in our in-depth Panasonic LX100 II review. Fujifilm GFX 100 Review 102.0mp | Non-Zoom | $6,699 With twice the resolution of earlier GFX models, the Fujifilm GFX 100, unsurprisingly, offers outstanding image quality. What's more, is that besides the 102MP sensor, the GFX 100 provides a shockingly impressive set of features, performance, video specs and build quality to make it unlike any other medium-format camera on the market. With features like in-body image stabilization, phase-detect AF, Cinema 4K video up to 30p, and weather-sealed construction, the Fuji GFX 100 is arguably the most versatile medium-format camera on the market. Its usability is hampered somewhat by performance limitations and a still-limited native GF lens lineup, but in the end, the Fujifilm GFX 100 is still a very unique camera, offering an enticing combination of resolution and performance that simply isn't found elsewhere on the market. Read more in our Fuji GFX 100 review! Fujifilm X-T30 Review 26.1mp | 3.0x | $799 The Fuji X-T30 is an impressive camera, not only for its image quality and performance but also for its price point. By and large, the X-T30 is a smaller, more affordable alternative to the rugged X-T3. Packing in the same 26MP X-Trans sensor, image processor and autofocus system as the X-T3, as well as similar high-res video shooting capabilities, the X-T30 is surprisingly robust in capabilities and features. Image quality is excellent, and autofocus performance is fast, accurate and responsive. And yet Fuji's priced the camera at just $800 body-only. If you're looking for a compact, easy-to-carry mirrorless cameras and don't need or want the extra bulk or weather-sealing of the X-T3, the X-T30 is a fantastic choice that'll also save you a nice chunk of change. Read more in our in-depth Fuji X-T30 Review! Nikon Z6 Review 24.5mp | 2.9x | $1,597 The Nikon Z6 is a terrific, well-rounded full-frame mirrorless camera. Basically, there isn't a lot to complain about when it comes to the Z6. The body is compact and robust yet features lots of physical controls and a familiar Nikon design. With excellent overall features, impressive image quality, nice build quality and design as well as a very competitive price point, the Nikon Z6 is a great all-around package. And while at this point in time, the Z6 appeals perhaps a bit more towards current Nikon owners, the Z6 is still a compelling camera for anyone looking to jump into the full-frame camera arena.
