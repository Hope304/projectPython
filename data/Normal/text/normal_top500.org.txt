The Frontier system at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, USA remains the No. 1 system on the TOP500 and is still the only system reported with an HPL performance exceeding one Exaflop/s. Frontier brought the pole position back to the USA one year ago on the June 2022 listing and has since been remeasured with an HPL score of 1.194 Exaflop/s. Frontier is based on the latest HPE Cray EX235a architecture and is equipped with AMD EPYC 64C 2GHz processors. The system has 8,699,904 total cores, a power efficiency rating of 52.59 gigaflops/watt, and relies on HPE’s Slingshot 11 network for data transfer. The Aurora system at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, Illinois, USA is currently being commissioned and will at full scale exceed Frontier with a peak performance of 2 Exaflop/s. It was submitted with a measurement on half of the final system achieving 585 Petaflop/s on the HPL benchmark which secured the No. 2 spot on the TOP500. Aurora is built by Intel based on the HPE Cray EX - Intel Exascale Compute Blade which uses Intel Xeon CPU Max Series processors and Intel Data Center GPU Max Series accelerators which communicate through HPE’s Slingshot-11 network interconnect. The Eagle system installed in the Microsoft Azure cloud in the USA is newly listed as No. 3. This Microsoft NDv5 system is based on Intel Xeon Platinum 8480C processors and NVIDIA H100 accelerators and achieved an HPL score of 561 Pflop/s. read more » List Statistics TOP500 Current List 25 Year Anniversary Newsletter Signup 1 Frontier - HPE Cray EX235a, AMD Optimized 3rd Generation EPYC 64C 2GHz, AMD Instinct MI250X, Slingshot-11, HPE 2 Aurora - HPE Cray EX - Intel Exascale Compute Blade, Xeon CPU Max 9470 52C 2.4GHz, Intel Data Center GPU Max, Slingshot-11, Intel 3 Eagle - Microsoft NDv5, Xeon Platinum 8480C 48C 2GHz, NVIDIA H100, NVIDIA Infiniband NDR, Microsoft 4 Supercomputer Fugaku - Supercomputer Fugaku, A64FX 48C 2.2GHz, Tofu interconnect D, Fujitsu 5 LUMI - HPE Cray EX235a, AMD Optimized 3rd Generation EPYC 64C 2GHz, AMD Instinct MI250X, Slingshot-11, HPE 6 Leonardo - BullSequana XH2000, Xeon Platinum 8358 32C 2.6GHz, NVIDIA A100 SXM4 64 GB, Quad-rail NVIDIA HDR100 Infiniband, EVIDEN 7 Summit - IBM Power System AC922, IBM POWER9 22C 3.07GHz, NVIDIA Volta GV100, Dual-rail Mellanox EDR Infiniband, IBM 8 MareNostrum 5 ACC - BullSequana XH3000, Xeon Platinum 8460Y+ 40C 2.3GHz, NVIDIA H100 64GB, Infiniband NDR200, EVIDEN 9 Eos NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD - NVIDIA DGX H100, Xeon Platinum 8480C 56C 3.8GHz, NVIDIA H100, Infiniband NDR400, Nvidia 10 Sierra - IBM Power System AC922, IBM POWER9 22C 3.1GHz, NVIDIA Volta GV100, Dual-rail Mellanox EDR Infiniband, IBM / NVIDIA / Mellanox Imprint Contact Log in or Sign up Copyright 1993-2023 TOP500.org (c)
