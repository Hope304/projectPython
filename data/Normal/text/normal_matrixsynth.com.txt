Here he shows how to assign a modulation envelope to the cut off filter to create variation in a riff and how to perform it live. This video also demonstrates how to fit it into a track, in this case he Is programming the riff in C Minor. This video is taken from the up and coming Sound Design course from the School of Synthesis, a follow up to the Scaler 2 Course, which will be available Q4 2023. 0:00 Intro 1:14 Making A Lead Sound on Melbourne Instruments Nina Analogue Synth 2:53 Programming A Sequence 4:13 Assigning A Modulation Envelope to the Cutoff Filter 5:55 Adding A Delay 7:10 Adding Oscillators and Shaping the Sound 10:25 Programming a Digital Synth to make a Lead Riff 11:53 Writing the Notes 13:50 Assigning A Modulation Envelope to the Cutoff Filter in Carbon Electra 15:30 Adding Variation and Performing Live" Posted by matrix at 3/05/2024 12:33:00 PM 0 comments LABELS/MORE: Melbourne Instruments, synth tutorials Melbourne Instruments NINA (MPE) cinematic drone musick video upload by a rat in the sewer of sound "Headphones strongly recommended!

My goal was to create a dynamic analog orchestral sound which would be able to 'cut thru' in a busy mix with Eurorack drums & voices. Two layers of sound were used (NINA is up to 4 times multitimbral). The Korg Kronos is (here) only used as Master-Keyboard to play NINA (no internal sounds were used). KeyStepPro was used to play some FM sounds from the DistingEX. Some deep bass via a Midi pedal and the PerFourMer. All other sounds from the Eurorack played by Hermod+ and transposed via the Midi bass pedal. All played live - no external effects used - recorded DAW-less with RME-Fireface."

The Korg Kronos is only used as master keyboard - all synth sounds (Organ, Bass, Lead) were created by NINA.

VCV Random is a Eurorack hardware version of the VCV Rack Random software module. It's a flexible and modulate-able multi output random generator with some novel features, namely, a step shape control that adds increasing numbers of steps between random values and a 'RND' crossfade control that crossfades the sampling of internal noise and the output. The latter resulting in a unique way to control voltage changes per step and one that can modulate over time.

The event will occur on Friday, March 29, at 7:00 p.m. It will feature an introductory reading by Executive Director Michelle Moog-Koussa from Bob Moog's biography, Switched On: Bob Moog and the Synthesizer Revolution, followed by a listening session of the full iconic 84-minute tape. Tickets for the event are $15 per person and are now on sale. The event is limited to 20 people, so do not hesitate to buy your ticket now. In the summer of 1964, Bob Moog and Herb Deutsch began working on what would eventually become the Moog modular prototype. Deutsch spent three weeks working side by side with Moog in his basement workshop in Trumansburg, New York, where he added crucial input to the design process. Moog spent several months developing the prototype and later that year, he sent Deutsch the now-historic tape explaining the various controls, parameters, and capabilities of the Moog modular prototype. The Moog modular prototype is widely considered the instrument that marked the genesis of a musical revolution and significantly advanced the development of electronic music. The Abominatron Tape captures the very first recorded sounds of a Moog modular. The Sounds of Innovation is supported by the North Carolina Arts Council, a division of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts."

Great Synth Mystery, mmm, maybe... but I wanted to make a compelling piece about such a wonderful instrument. As a musician and not a reviewer or journalist I think this really speaks to how ahead of it's time the Access Virus Ti was."
