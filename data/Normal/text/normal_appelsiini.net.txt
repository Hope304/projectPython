First time 2017, then again in 2019 and 2020. I do not remember what was the drama then. Each time I procrastinated and thought things are not that bad yet. Leaving all politics a side, this is not the way the Internet was supposed to be. “The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is fascism – ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power.” —Franklin D. Roosevelt, excerpt from message to Congress, April 29, 1938 TL;DR: Social media services such as Twitter and Instagram could be recreated with an RSS like file format. No platform needed.

Written information is a bit sparse at the moment. Let’s try to fix this with a quick writeup on wiring and programming the board. If you just want to see what the board can do here is a video instead. Read More… Creating a Videoplayer for ESP32 Mon, May 25, 2020 One of the things which makes embedded programming so interesting is that you are constantly dealing with restricted resources. Playing video files is quite resource heavy. Let’s see how ESP32 can handle this. If you have short attention span here is a video instead.

HAGL is a hardware agnostic graphics library for embedded projects. It supports basic geometric primitives, bitmaps, blitting, fixed width fonts and an optional framebuffer.

I remember sitting in my parents basement in the late 90’s programming the fire effect using mixture of Borland Turbo Pascal and Assembler. I had an Intel 80386 which also had the 80387 coprocessor. I remember downloading Lode’s graphics tutorials from FidoNet. It was all magic. Last week I found myself reading the same tutorials and creating the same fire effect again. Instead of Intel PC, it was written for ESP32 based M5Stack and using C programming language. Read More… How to Calibrate a Magnetometer? Fri, Feb 23, 2018 Magnetometers are used to measure the strength of a magnetic field. They can also be used to determine orientation and to compensate gyro drift. Magnetometer provides the last three degrees of freedom in 9DOF sensors. There is one problem though, magnetometers are prone to distortion. Read More… Wifi Geolocation With MicroPython Tue, Feb 6, 2018 While evaluating M5Stack for a sidehustle project I created a proof of concept which needed to access wifi network, query an API and download an image. Wifi geolocation which displays a static Google map seemed like a perfect fit. Here are some notes about it.

It has 320x240 TFT screen, three buttons, sd card slot, Grove I2C connector and can be powered with LiPo battery. Download the Micropython Firmware You could download the MicroPython firmware from the downloads page. But why bother when we have the commandline. First find the download link. $ curl --silent http://micropython.org/download | grep "firmware/esp32" | gawk -F'<a +href="' -v RS='">' 'RT{print $2}' http://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp32-20180127-v1.9.3-240-ga275cb0f.bin Read More… Update Pycom WiPy Firmware From Commandline Sun, Sep 24, 2017 WiPy is a bit pricey but good quality ESP32 development board from Pycom. I got mine from Pimoroni. Pycom does offer their own firmware updater but for my taste it has too much magic going on. I prefer to do things from commandline and I stay in control and to see exactly what update is doing. Quick Googling did not reveal anything so here is my upgrade procedure. Download the Latest Pycom Firmware For starters we need to find the latest Pycom firmware. Links can be found from their forums. Or you can just query the filename from their software update service. $ curl "https://software.pycom.io/findupgrade?key=wipy.wipy%20with%20esp32&redirect=false&type=all" { "key":"wipy.wipy with esp32", "file":"https://software.pycom.io/downloads/WiPy-1.7.10.b1.tar.gz", "version":"1.8.0.b1", "intVersion":71303297, "hash":"f6c30bf8b08c50d188f727822be320061ed7847b" } Read More… Branca as an Alternative to JWT? Sun, Aug 6, 2017 Branca is a catchy name for IETF XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD message with an additional version number and timestamp. It is well suited to be used as an authenticated and encrypted API token. Branca specification does not specify the payload format. Among others you can use for example JWT payloads but still have modern encryption and smaller token size provided by Branca. Currently there are implemenations for JavaScript, Elixir, Go and PHP and a command line tool for creating and inspecting tokens. Read More…
