The mission, called PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem), will improve scientists’ understanding of the carbon cycle. 4 Saturn’s ‘Death Star’ Moon Might Contain a Hidden Ocean, Science News An uncanny resemblance to the Death Star might not be the only intriguing thing about Saturn’s moon Mimas. It could also harbor a vast ocean of liquid water beneath its pockmarked exterior.
