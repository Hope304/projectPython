Contact me Newsletter nice to meet you! Hi üëã I'm Tristan I've always enjoyed combining tech and design to visually represent ideas and answer questions. It was, therefore, natural that I was drawn to data visualization.For the first five years of my professional life, I used mainly Tableau at work and on my personal projects. When working on business dashboards, my goal is always to have a clean, simple, and efficient design. On the other hand, I like to work on personal projects to experiment, have fun, and try new visual approaches. With this approach, I was lucky to win the Iron Viz competition, the Tableau Hackathon and become a Tableau Ambassador. Later I invented and shared new techniques to create complex charts in Tableau. All of this resulted in Tableau awarding me the title of VisionaryToday, I'm working as a Data Visualization Freelancer to help you make the best out of your data. I can help you at any step of your project by helping you choose the right tool, providing training, building insightful visualizations, and solving your technical issues.
