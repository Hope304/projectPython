Reviews Film TV Music Legit ‘Dune: Part Two’ Timothee Chalamet grows up -- and so do the sand worms -- in Denis Villeneuve's epic follow-up. ‘Drive-Away Dolls’ As a free-spirited horndog, Margaret Qualley stakes out her star quality in Ethan Coen's queer crime joyride. ‘Spaceman’ As a Czech astronaut suffering from loneliness, Adam Sandler gets lost in space. ‘Madame Web’ Playing a fringe character with ill-defined powers and nothing especially interesting to do, Dakota Johnson leads a Marvel entry that feels superfluous. ‘Mr. and Mrs. Smith’ This version of 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' with Donald Glover and Maya Erskine may not make as many headlines as its predecessor, but it stands up far better to scrutiny. ‘Feud: Capote vs. The Swans’ Naomi Watts and Chloë Sevigny lead a glamorous flock in Ryan Murphy's surprisingly sad series. ‘Expats’ Nicole Kidman astounds in Prime Video's haunting series about womanhood and regret. 'Masters of the Air' Austin Butler's World War II drama is riveting when it looks beyond the combat. ‘Sol Maria’ Eladio Carrión's 'Sol María' finds its balance in experimental Latin trap. ‘Saviors’ Green Day's sociopolitical sarcasm ages well in sharp 'Saviors.' ‘American Dream’ 21 Savage plays to his strengths with deadpan wit on 'American Dream.' ‘New Blue Sun’ André 3000's solo debut eschews Outkast-style rap for a peaceful, easy feeling album. ‘Purlie Victorious’ This revival of the Ossie Davis satire is a delightful romp centering Black joy and the absurdity of racism. ‘Rebecca’ The musical's English-language debut is a remarkable debacle. ‘Peter Pan Goes Wrong’ If pratfalls piling up is wrong, this Ahmanson production doesn't want to be right. ‘Back to the Future’ The car is the star in this underwhelming screen-to-stage duplication.
