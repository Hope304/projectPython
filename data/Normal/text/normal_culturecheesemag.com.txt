The event is in support of the @annesaxelbylegacyfund which provides fully-funded month-long internships to young adults interested in artisan food production. Wonder what it’s like to be an ASLF intern? We chatted with Carrie (aka @justiceofthecheese ) to learn about their time making cheese @fireflycheese. As a cheesemonger, this was Carries first opportunity to actually make cheese. “It was a transformational journey going into the make room and taking the cheese through its life process,” they said.

TfL said it “uses the Food Standards Agency’s model to define foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt”⁠ ⁠ While we understand the need to promote healthy habits and remove “unhealthy” messaging, we turophiles know that cheese can be—and in our case, is—part of a healthy diet. Cheese is high in protein, vitamins, and calcium, not to mention it’s a whole food with minimal processing and has been shown to increase gut health.⁠ ⁠ So, what do you think? Should this ad have been banned?
