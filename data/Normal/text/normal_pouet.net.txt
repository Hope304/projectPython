Sign up and purchase your ticket at the offical website here: https://xparty.netThe X parties are renowned in the demoscene since 1995. Each edition just gets louder, colorfuller, stupider, drunker and straight up awesomer. As usual, Silicon Ltd, SCS*TRC and Xenon invite you to join us in celebrating 8-bit culture.X2024 starts Friday May 10th until Sunday May 12th in Someren, the Netherlands. For X the Commodore 64 home computer is more than just an ancient relic of pre-internet technology. It's our voice, our art, our dreams and desires all packed into a machine that some people would use as mere vintage living room decoration.It's our weapon of choice to create amazing art within a very limited scope, and we're damn proud of that! So come on over and enjoy a great weekend with the machine you love! See this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZYjsS5t_hc for a nice impression of an earlier edition of X! Today X is being held in the same venue!
