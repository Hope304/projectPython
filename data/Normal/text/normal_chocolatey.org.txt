The I.T. department staff at P.R.I.D.E., Inc. were early adopters of Chocolatey and the product had become an integral part of processes. Chocolatey improves our efficiency, increases consistency across workstations, and provides easy access to software that is vital to our engineers daily workflow. Truly a revolutionary solution to a problem that has plagued Windows since inception. Keith Davis IT Director at P.R.I.D.E Chocolatey has gone from a convenience to a necessity. It has helped us automate third party software updates, which has improved end user experiences and our on-site security. It has saved time by reducing the volume of calls to our help desk for simple issues like Flash Player updates, so we can focus on other issues. Chocolatey has helped us wrangle all of the applications we use into one manageable and automation friendly interface. Alex Markessinis Senior Network Administrator at The Sage Colleges We were looking for an efficient and seamless way to deploy software on servers and workstations without hindering user experience. Chocolatey has definitely helped us a great deal with automated deployments. The package builder is also a great way of creating custom install packages for business-specific software. Overall it has saved us a lot of time and hassle. The Tricore Team Tricore In the SMB market we just don't have the resources to dedicate an entire FTE to managing a complex configuration management tool. As a result, these types of monumental products tend to fail monumentally. Chocolatey is allowing us to leverage modular DevOps practices in a much more economical way. Itâ€™s well worth investing in Chocolatey for Business, which provides the extra tooling we need to realize our DevOps goals faster. Dave Negrotto TSenior Manager, IT at The J.
