Although our main objective is to provide clean water and sanitation, we truly believe water is so important that access to it can improve a lot of the community's condition.Explore the Sustainable Development Goals and how each one of them is related to water: Just 29% of the low-income population has access to safely managed drinking water facilities It takes between 2000 and 5000 liters of water to produce a person’s daily food: 70% of the freshwater available is used for agriculture. In 1 in 4 primary schools, there is no drinking water service. That number drops to 1 in 6 at the secondary school level. In 80 percent of households experiencing water scarcity, women and girls are responsible for collecting water. This often means having to travel long distances,and carry heavy loads. Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces. When water comes from improved and more accessible sources, people spend less time and effort physically collecting it, meaning they can be productive in other ways. Some 829 000 people are estimated to die each year from diarrhea as a result of unsafe drinking water, sanitation, and hand hygiene. (WHO) The distribution of water resources is unequal among the countries. Some of them have a daily consumption per cápita of 547 liters, while others just 2.
