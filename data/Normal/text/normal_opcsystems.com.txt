High-speed data logging to open database engines including: MSSQL Server and SQL Azure Oracle, mySQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, SQLite, InfluxDB, Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Google Firebase, MS Access (Windows only), CSV Files Databases can also be used as a source of inbound data using the Recipe Feature from any supported database engine Move data to and from popular cloud-based IoT services for adding real time data to your IoT analytics pipeline. Supported IoT services include: AWS IoT Gateway Azure IoT Data Hub Additionally, using the MQTT Connector you can: Send data updates to any MQTT broker as an MQTT Client, or publish updates to any client using the OAS MQTT Broker. Log historical Alarm data to any supported data destination available for data logging such as open database engines including MSSQL, Oracle, mySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and CSV files. Receive Alarm Notifications via: Email, SMS, Voice based on highly configurable parameters on each data point. Visualization of live and historical data, as well as live and historical Trends and Alarms in WinForms and WPF applications, and deliver visualization in any web browser and any web platform. OAS provides SDKs and tools for web, mobile, and desktop application development using data from any OAS server. Additionally, the OAS REST API can be used on any platform for programmatic data access and server configuration. Learn more about the benefits of an open platform for visualization. The OAS Platform also ships with a built-in Web HMI Dashboard for rapid no-code visualization in any web browser on any device. .NET Data Connector A set of .NET Core assemblies, allowing for custom application and integration projects for both reading and writing data, as well as full programmatic configuration of OAS installations.OAS REST API The REST API can be used with any programming language on any platform for data access and OAS server configuration.Universal Driver Interface (UDI) An SDK which allows you to build custom integrated drivers for proprietary or non-standard protocols or integration with external services. Integrations using the UDI can then be configured in the OAS Configuration application just like all native built-in drivers. Infinitely Flexible Secure Networking Built upon a Distributed Network Architecture that enables advanced Edge Computing, reliability, and performance for IIoT, the OAS Platform can be deployed in infinite configurations to meet your needs. Interconnect OAS servers for load balancing, failover, data aggregation from remote clients, and more. Basic Networking Network clients, either over LAN, WAN, or Internet can communicate directly with an OAS Platform server.
