Helping you, the reported business or individual My company has been reported! How do I respond? If you are a business with one or more reports filed against you, you can make it right. If handled correctly, Ripoff Report(s) filed against you can actually help improve your credibility and reputation. We offer you, for FREE, the opportunity to file a REBUTTAL to any report. (See the “REBUTTAL BOX™ | Respond to this Report!” at the top of the specific Report you wish to comment on or the “Respond to this report!” button at theend of the specific Report you wish to comment on). Every company receives complaints, but how they handle those complaints separates good business from the rest.. If you want to do more than file a rebuttal, you might consider using Ripoff Report’s VIP Arbitration Program. The arbitration program gives you the opportunity to prove, through a neutral third-party arbitrator, that the report about you is false. Ripoff Report developed the program in response to phone calls and emails from businesses like you -- those who have worked hard to create a good reputation and are having that reputation unjustly tarnished because of a false posting on Ripoff Report. Because Ripoff Report has never had the internal resources to investigate reports that a business claims is false, it has always permitted the subject of the report to file its own, free, Rebuttal. But some of you feel that is not enough. You have asked for more. You want the ability to prove it is false. You want an independent investigation. Perhaps most importantly, you want the false statements of fact removed. We listened to your concerns and launched VIP Arbitration in response. Here’s how it works. We have contracted with private arbitrators who have extensive experience, including experience as judges in court. You submit a written arbitration statement identifying the specific false statements in the Report, and/or explaining that the report was posted by a competitor pretending to be a customer. You are also given the opportunity to support your position with documentary evidence and/or sworn declarations. There is a filing fee of $2,000 to pay for the arbitrator’s time and for administration of the program. The author of the Report is then given the opportunity to respond and you are given the opportunity to reply. The arbitrator then reviews all of the submissions and renders a written decision. In the event that the arbitrator determines that the challenged statements of fact in the Report are true, there will be no updates or changes to the website. If the Arbitrator finds that statements in the Report are false, the title of the Report will be updated, posting this phrase BEFORE the original title: "Notice of Arbitrator Decision: A neutral and independent arbitrator has determined that the following Report contained one or more false statements of fact. The false statements have been redacted." A summary of the arbitrator’s decision will be posted after the title and before the original content of the report. Any statements of fact that the arbitrator determines to be false will be removed (((REDACTED))) from the original report. If you think this program may be right for you take the next step and, click here to learn more about how to get started with the VIP Arbitration Program. Another option is the Corporate Advocacy Program. Businesses that want to make a real difference should read about the very successful, groundbreaking and innovative program that both businesses and consumers are raving about. This program is a way businesses can turn negatives into a positive. Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program is a program that benefits the consumer, assuring them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business.

Do you really want to sue Rip-off Report? ..you really need to read this link. Employee insider / ex-employee information If you are an employee or ex-employee with information about a reported company or individual, please click on the REBUTTAL box at the end of the Ripoff Report to post your comments. This sort of information is often very helpful to an investigation. Whistleblowers Employees who want to expose corruption may file a Ripoff Report. Any employees who do so should be protected by Federal Whistleblower Laws, and Ripoff Report treats all victims as a confidential source. We will protect our sources under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. DOING BUSINESS WITH THE COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL REPORTED Consumers, just because a company or individual is reported on Rip-off Report does not necessarily mean you should not do business with them. In many cases, it’s just the opposite. Just because a company is posted on Rip-off Report does not mean they are "bad". At some point in time, everyone has felt like they've been ripped off, when that may not have been the case. Not everything published on the Internet, or local newspapers, or local TV news is always true. Many stories, no matter where you see them, may have a bias slant. Being short on space or only having less than 2 minutes to do a story where important facts are left out can change the entire story. Rip-off Report feels consumers reading the unedited experiences of other consumers, without editorial involvement, are getting the best consumer opinion/news available. Our detractors would like to tell you differently. Savvy consumers need to take in all the information they can find and use it as an advantage. Consumers who investigate and obtain information about a company from a number of sources will be able to make more educated decisions, because they know what to watch for. By reading Rip-off Report, or any other publication containing information about businesses, you, the consumer, now know more about that business than its competitors. More than likely the competitor has the same issues. Let the reported business know you’ve read complaints about them, that you would like to do business with them, and get affirmation from the company that if you do business with them, they will do right by you. Let them know that if they treat you right, you will log on to Rip-off Report and tell the world what a great experience you’ve had. All companies make mistakes. It is the ones that learn from their mistakes that will benefit the consumers the most. "An educated consumer is our best reader" USE YOUR REPORT TO GET WHAT IS COMING TO YOU Faxing your Ripoff Report to the company or individual you have just reported can serve as a very valuable negotiating tool. Include in your negotiation that you have the ability to UPDATE your Report and reflect their good business practices by explaining that their eagerness to satisfy the complaint and make things right will be seen by the entire world. Also, explain that failure to respond/rectify the situation will also be seen. YOU MUST NOT call them threatening to file a report if they do not comply with your demands, as this may be construed as blackmail! You must first file a Ripoff Report, then fax them a copy, offering them a chance to rectify the wrong that they did to you. Explain that then, and only then, you will UPDATE your Ripoff Report in a positive way, if deserved. Organizing class action lawsuits Victims & lawyers who want to sue companies or individuals reported Victims & attorneys who are interested in pursuing litigation against a particular company reported on this website must contact us directly. It is inappropriate to solicit business using this website other than through prior arrangement. This is largely because we need to ensure, the best we can, that our readers are not being taken advantage of again. If you are interested in filing a class action lawsuit based on Reports you’ve seen posted, and you want to identify a class representative, we can help by e-mailing those victims that gave permission and asking them to contact you. In this way, we protect victim identities while allowing them to make the decision as to whether to participate or not. Additionally, if you would like to know whether any new reports are being posted AS THEY GET POSTED, such as during the early stages of an investigation, you may be interested in our upcoming Ripoff Alerts program. We’ll update you shortly on how you can participate in these valuable programs. We are anxious and willing to join forces with victims and attorneys to stand up for the rights of consumers and help them get justice. Both victims and attorneys should send their e-mails to: Legal@RipoffReport.com. It's important to file on Ripoff Report because we're important to government and media agencies Many sites and organizations (like the BBB) are in place to collect information from you, the consumer, but in many cases, those reports never become available for others to see. Listing your complaint on Ripoff Report insures that your report will be seen, and not just placed in a a database where only privileged eyes can see them. Making your report available on Ripoff Report helps educate consumers. Many government agencies come to the Ripoff Report for information. We have assisted, and continue to assist, many government agencies, including local and state police departments, the FBI, FTC and Attorney General offices from around the country. Since all the Reports are out in the open, consumers, journalists, attorneys and investigators from all types of agencies can research existing problems and anticipate potential problems. We provide immediate access to all kinds of fraud and scams, all out in the open, all unedited and all for FREE.
