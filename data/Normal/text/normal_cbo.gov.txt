In addition, the agency estimates the budgetary effects of three illustrative options that would rescind varying amounts of the IRS’s mandatory funding. In CBO’s assessment, rescissions of the IRS’s mandatory funding would increase the cumulative deficit over the 2024–2034 period because revenues would be reduced by more than the decrease in spending. CBO estimates that a rescission of $5 billion, $20 billion, or $35 billion would reduce revenues by $5.2 billion, $44 billion, or $89 billion, respectively, over the 2024–2034 period.
