Please kindly refer to our Size Chart to choose the correct size. If your measurements align with our size chart, I suggest you choose standard size. If your measurements cannot be found in the size chart, I recommend you choose custom size to ensure the dress fits you. Read Article Read Article 2. Will my item be exactly the same color as what is shown on your website? Our color charts online have been adjusted to display color as close as possible to the color of the actual fabrics. However, camera resolution and computer monitors can mean the color may vary slightly between the photos and the actual fabric. Colors are subject to the actual dresses you get. We suggest you order a fabric swatch to view colors in person. Read Article Read Article 3. Could we get color swatches to see what the colors look like in reality? Yes, color swatches are just $2 each. They take anywhere from 2-10 business days to arrive. Order swatches. Read Article Read Article 4. How can I make sure all of my dresses are the same color? Color consistency is of the utmost importance of course. However, there is a chance that there will be slight variations if dresses in same color submit several orders at different times. Because batches of fabric are produced at different times, the same fabric of the same color at different times might be slightly different. You need to order all dresses within 24 hours and contact us to tell us all the dress should be in the same color. Then, all the dresses will be cut from the same bolt of fabric to make sure they come in the exact same color. After 24 hours, we cannot guarantee any late orders will be included in the same dye lot as the rest of your party. Keep in mind that screen resolutions can alter the way colors look on your computer depending on how you have it set. We always recommend ordering Swatches (free shipping) beforehand so you can see the true color quality of each fabric in person. Please note that different types of fabrics do take the dye differently, and will not match perfectly. Read Article Read Article 5. Can I change the design of a dress?

If your item arrives damaged or defective, please reach out to our Customer Service team directly for assistance with processing your return. Please keep in mind that all dresses are uniquely made to order to keep costs low for our customers. We also understand that colors on your computer screen can be a little different to how they appear in person. For these reasons, we encourage you to order a Swatch (free shipping) to help you decide. FOR ALL RETURNS: JJ's House will only issue one prepaid return label per order. You will be responsible for paying shipping fees including, but not limited to, the cost to ship and any shipping materials on additional returns. Because of this, we recommend returning all unwanted items at one time. FOR ALL STANDARD SIZE DRESSES, SHOES, AND ACCESSORIES: JJ's House will issue a full refund of the cost of the returned product if you are not satisfied with your item(s). Contact our Customer Service to initiate the return process within 14 days upon receiving your item(s). The item must be returned in its original condition (if eligible per the return policy). Please note: * The item must be unworn, unwashed, unaltered, undamaged and with the original tags attached. We cannot process the return of any faulty item. * Original shipping fee & return shipping fee will not be refunded. * As all items (including standard size) are made-to-order, we cannot afford to accept the ‘buy-many-keep-one’ purchase.

To help you out, we offer custom sizing on most of our dresses. Custom sizing takes the same amount of time to make and ship to you! A few things to remember about custom dresses: Custom dresses are made specifically to the measurements you provide (bust, waist, hips, height, and hollow-to-floor). That means no one else will be able to wear that dress once it's made. Because of this, we are unable to accept any returns on custom dresses. Please double check your measurements and color choice before ordering. We understand that sometimes small alterations are needed, we offer limited alterations reimbursement for only our custom sizes. Simply send us a picture of your receipt from the tailor and your order number and we'll do the rest! Yes, it really is that easy!

Due to hygiene issues there are no returns/exchanges. FOR ALL SAMPLE SALE ITEMS: All Sample Sale items are final sale. No returns, no refunds, no exchages. EXCHANGE POLICY We do not offer an exchange service for any products at this time. Because all items are made-to-order, we do not have ready-made dresses or products that can be shipped in exchange for your returned items. You will need to return unwanted items (if eligible per the return policy), and then place a new order for the replacement items. All new orders are subject to the current production period. HOW TO RETURN 1. Submit a return request at Contact Us to Customer Service within 14 days of receiving your order. Please include the reason for return and photographs for verification. 2.
