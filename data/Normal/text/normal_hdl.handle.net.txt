Handle Proxy Resolve a Handle and View the Values The web form below will enable you to resolve individual handles and view their associated values. It uses a proxy server, which understands both the Handle protocol and HTTP protocol. If you type a handle into the text box, and that handle has a URL associated with it as one of its values, the proxy server will instruct your browser to display the location of that URL. If you select "Don't Redirect to URLs", the proxy will display the handle record. The Handle proxy server uses caching to speed handle resolution. If you check "Authoritative Query", the proxy will bypass the cache, go directly to the responsible handle server, and then refresh the cache with the data for that handle. Simply appending a handle to the URL http://hdl.handle.net/ and giving the string to a browser as a location will also resolve that handle. The proxy also supports a REST API, returning handle records in JSON format. Further documentation is available here.
