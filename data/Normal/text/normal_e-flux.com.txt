It evokes a sense of community and belonging that can prove elusive for the diverse group of people commonly referred to as “Chinese American,” a one-size-fits-all label that attempts to forge a singular identity out of a heterogeneous array of diasporic experiences shaped by displacement, immigration, and cross-cultural translation. Tania Bruguera’s “Where Your Ideas Become Civic Actions (100 Hours Reading The Origins of Totalitarianism)” Eugene Yiu Nam Cheung Hamburger Bahnhof—Nationalgalerie der Gegenwart This participatory public reading of—and discussion around—Hannah Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) was spread across four days, featuring the artist alongside writers such as Masha Gessen and Deborah Feldman, prominent artists in Berlin including Candice Breitz, as well as people from “the museum’s neighborhood.” Madeline Hollander’s “Entanglement” Maddie Hampton Bortolami Gallery In profile, the six rounded disks at the center of Madeline Hollander’s latest exhibition appear glamorously extraterrestrial, the bright bulbs of the track lighting glinting in their polished chrome surfaces. Arranged in a grid on curved, white pedestals, the satellite-shaped objects are constructed from parabolic mirrors, a hole cut at the top of each to reveal a sinewy figure cast in aluminum, revolving atop a bifurcated circle of colored glass. Suneil Sanzgiri’s “Here the Earth Grows Gold” Phil Coldiron Brooklyn Museum Sanzgiri, mercifully, is not such a literal artist that this reads as a single screen broken. Or perhaps he is, to the extent that today’s “political art”—which Two Refusals surely is—seems obliged to concern itself with the question of popular legibility, of clear communication. But to be concerned with that question is not to respond in the uncomplicated affirmative; I’ll risk that this is one of the gaps between art and political action, and that this is at least in part what his screen-based installation figures. Jane Jin Kaisen’s “Halmang” Dylan Huw esea contemporary Halmang gives this tightly focused exhibition at Manchester’s esea contemporary its title and centerpiece. With a refreshing formal lucidity, it literalizes themes of familial and geopolitical ties that have been central to Kaisen’s work in film and video over the last decade and a half. Drawn out throughout the exhibition are the artist’s excavations, via archival materials and moving image works of the embodied and geopoetic afterlives of modern Jeju Island’s key political flashpoints. Ho Tzu Nyen’s “Time & the Tiger” Adeline Chia Singapore Art Museum Ho’s self-narrating, self-theorizing, and sometimes even self-interpreting practice involves a thorough immersion in a range of research topics, resulting in a cathartic showing and telling that has become his signature style. “Time & the Tiger”, a mid-career survey of works made from 2003 to the present day offering a cogent genealogy of Ho’s practice, focuses on questions about identity and history, most notably “What is Southeast Asia?” and “What is Singapore?” Pedro Lasch’s “Entre líneas / Between the Lines” Mariana Fernández Laboratorio Arte Alameda LATINO/A AMÉRICA (2003–23) proposes a new map of the American continent based on the union of North and South America, both of which are rendered in red paint and labeled in white with the words “Latino/a” and “America.” Lasch first developed the work when he was working with immigrant organizations in New York in 2003, at which point he gave forty copies of these maps to twenty people who would be traveling between Mexico and the United States. Hanan Benammar’s “The Soil Is Fertile But For A Distant Seed” Natasha Marie Llorens Bomuldsfabriken Kunsthall Benammar was born in Paris into a politically engaged Algerian family, and relocated to Norway in her twenties to find some relief from the oppressive racism directed at the North African diaspora in France. Her engagement with Norwegian aesthetic codes reveals a particular complexity because she refuses to address racism in the abstract, instead persistently interrogating its local manifestations. Kwan Sheung Chi’s “Not retrospective” Stephanie Bailey Kiang Malingue A selection of Kwan’s video works cycle through this three-channel space, including the black-and-white Handover (2023), where the hands of Kwan, his wife and frequent collaborator, artist Wong Wai Yin, and their son, pass a glass made of ice between them until it melts. The video’s title, while faithfully representing its content, is an unmistakable reference to the 1997 Handover, when Hong Kong was transferred from British to Chinese rule: another kind of dissolution.
