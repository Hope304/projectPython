Create Chatbot Set up Help Desk Set up Livechat Frequently Asked Questions What is Appy Pie’s no-code technology and who can use it? Appy Pie’s no-code technology is exactly what it sounds like, programming without coding to build enterprise-grade applications. A few years ago, if you had an idea for a really good game, app, or another program, the only way to bring it to life was to either know to code (and pray you knew the right programming language) or be willing to learn on the fly. If you had money, you could hire someone to do it for you. That was pretty much it. That’s not true anymore: now, instead of learning a whole programming language (or even several), you only need to understand how a single program works before you can work on your inspiration. While you’ll still need to be persistent and hard-working, the burden of technical knowledge has been lifted substantially. Let us now address the question of who uses Appy Pie’s no-code technology. Anyone can use Appy Pie’s no-code technology. There is no need for formal training, education, or specific skill acquisition to use a no-code platform. With Appy Pie, anybody can create applications, websites, chatbots, and more on any internet-connected device without having to hire a programmer or agency. No-code is the future of programming, democratizing technology so that anyone with a laptop and internet can bring their dream tech project to reality. “You no longer need to become a programmer to build things on the internet, empowering a new wave of makers from different backgrounds and perspectives,” said Ryan Hoover, Founder of Product Hunt. So, whether you are a non-tech employee, an entrepreneur, or any other kind of business user, you can easily use Appy Pie’s no-code platform to make your own pieces of software. Appy Pie’s drag-and-drop interface makes it possible for everyone to build their own applications, empowering citizen programmers and putting a check on the rise of shadow IT. Gartner estimates by 2025, 70% of new applications created by enterprises will use no-code or low-code technologies (up from less than 25% in 2020). However, it is not just the non-coders who can benefit from no-code technology. Here’s what Sahil Lavingia, Founder and CEO of Gumroad, tweeted about it. “No code” isn’t just about helping non-coders build things. It’s also about helping coders build things. Some of our top creators are incredibly competent engineers who don’t want to deal with payments, fraud, VAT, and other burdens that come with selling stuff online. Why Should You Choose a No-Code App Platform like Appy Pie? There has been a lot of conversation around no-code, and the adoption rate is quite high. Microsoft anticipates that the 500 million apps it expects will be created over the next five years, 450 million will be designed on no-code low-code platforms. However, just because everyone else is choosing no-code, it does not mean you should too. Let’s look at why a no-code platform like Appy Pie may be the perfect choice for you! Efficient Use of Internal Resources Using external resources and agencies for creating enterprise-grade applications can burn a hole in your pocket. Moreover, it would be a challenging exercise, as it requires constant back-and-forth on every minute aspect, which makes it limiting and restrictive. At the same time, you would hardly ever be able to access the application’s backend. Therefore, internal application creation is critical, but most enterprises are unable to afford it due to budget and human resource constraints. The cost of hiring skilled programmers is very high, which is where Appy Pie’s no-code platform comes into the picture. Instead of hiring a whole team of programmers, you can invest a fraction of that cost into your Appy Pie subscription. Appy Pie’s no-code software lets anyone, irrespective of their technical expertise, budget, or time constraints, build their own business applications. Easier to Change and Customize With the no-code platform, users can enjoy a plethora of customization features that allow them to modify their applications based on their evolving requirements. Users can change anything they want instantly without worrying about introducing bugs or glitches while trying to improve their application and add better features through the Appy Pie platform. Faster time-to-market Traditional methotds requires anywhere between 4 to 12 months and involves constant deliberations and discussions with the tech department. Every new feature addition would require a cycle of discussions and meetings with programmers, slowing down the entire process. No-code low-code platforms like Appy Pie can reduce the time by 90%. No-code can accelerate speed-to-market (RedHat, 2018); what usually takes months can be reduced to just a few minutes. Depending on the type of application you want to build, it can take anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes to build and launch a fully functional app. When you build an app faster, you also get to deploy or release it faster for your customers. Cost of Ownership is Less This one shouldn’t come as a surprise to you. No-code reduces the cost of ownership. All the application data is stored on a secure cloud, reducing or, in fact eliminating entirely the need to spend on servers and their maintenance. It saves a massive amount of money as you only need to spend a minuscule amount on server maintenance with your cloud-based software application, compared to what you would with traditional methods. Better ROI and Low Risk Because the no-code is considerably cost-effective, it can offer you a better return on your investments. You can save up on a lot of your resources while using Appy Pie’s no-code technology, compared to what you would have spent on traditional methods. 100% of low-code enterprises have received ROI from their low-code adoption. (Appian, 2019). These ROIs are even greater when it comes to Appy PIe’s no-code technology. A better ROI also means that investing in no-code is a lower risk. In case your application fails, you are likely to have spent a lot less on your project than you would if you were to choose traditional methods. Easier Learning Curve No-code can be learned and used by anyone with limited to no technical expertise or understanding. Appy Pie’s simple drag-and-drop visual editor allows users to add features of their choice without having to write even a single line of code. The process is relatively intuitive, and the learning curve is almost flat. This is why no-code has gained such wild popularity among small businesses, solopreneurs, and startups. There is no need to acquire any special training, nor is there a need to hire a programmer or an agency to do the heavy-lifting for you. Anyone can use it to create their own pieces of software. Future-Proof Technology By 2024, 80% of technology products and services will be built by those who are not technology professionals (Gartner, 2021). If we have learned anything from the past, it is that technology is moving towards convenience, and no-code platforms give you just that! The global no-code low-code platform market is forecast to amount to $65 billion U.S. dollars by 2027. No-code is here to stay, and if you start using a no-code platform today, you will definitely have found a way to stay ahead of the curve. No-code is the future of applications, and it is only going to evolve more in tune with the changing demands of the market. The global no-code low-code platform market is forecast to amount to $65 billion U.S. dollars by 2027. What are the features of Appy Pie’s no-code platform?
