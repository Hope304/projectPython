As part of monitoring devices we use nmap to issue icmp echo requests to a list of target devices, and obviously the lack of a reply is worthy of generating an event/alert/alarm.

Re: nmap to use with sudo (but prevent privilege escalation vectors) Robin Wood (Oct 29) Hi What about if you put nmap in a docker container and after each scan threw the container away and built a new one for the next scan. That way you could lock down as far as you can, but if the user manages to read the shadow file or overwrite something important, they would only destroy their instance and not affect the rest of the system. I will add though, my docker skills are very limited, so this is just a vague idea that may be a load of...
