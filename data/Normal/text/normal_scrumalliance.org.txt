Trustpilot Trustpilot What Scrum Alliance members say As someone coming from a non-IT/engineering background, I was keen to expand my knowledge of agile methodologies and team collaboration. Scrum Alliance provided the perfect platform for me to achieve these goals. One of the highlights of my learning journey was the supportive and knowledgeable instructors. Their expertise in agile practices and real-world experience brought the concepts to life. They were patient, encouraging, and always willing to answer questions and provide valuable insights. I truly appreciated their dedication to creating an engaging and interactive learning environment. The Scrum Alliance trainer provided me with a comprehensive understanding of scrum, including its principles, roles, artifacts, and events using real-life and practical experiences. Other participants and I gained a solid foundation in scrum practices, and we can apply them effectively in our organizations. I highly recommend the CSM certification from Scrum Alliance to anyone looking to enhance their agile knowledge and become a skilled scrum master. It has been a truly enriching experience that will undoubtedly benefit my career and the teams I work with. Thank you, Scrum Alliance, for offering such a remarkable certification program.
