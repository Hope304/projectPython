In September, SIPRI released a series of video interviews with local people and humanitarian workers in South Sudan’s Jonglei State, exploring their perceptions of food security, violence and development challenges. ‘Food security and why it matters for peace in South Sudan’ mixes extracts from those interviews with new footage and graphics. Watch the film and interview series on SIPRI’s YouTube channel.
