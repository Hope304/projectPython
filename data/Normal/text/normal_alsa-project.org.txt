ALSA has the following significant features: Efficient support for all types of audio interfaces, from consumer sound cards to professional multichannel audio interfaces. Fully modularized sound drivers. SMP and thread-safe design (PLEASE READ THIS). User space library (alsa-lib) to simplify application programming and provide higher level functionality. Support for the older Open Sound System (OSS) API, providing binary compatibility for most OSS programs. ALSA Project on GitHub (no releases there) Please, help us to provide better content and organisation on this wiki. Read the Community Portal for more details. New ALSA Users We need users to use, test and provide feedback on drivers and applications using ALSA. If you are interested, please subscribe to a mailing list. Is my soundcard supported? How do I test my soundcard?
