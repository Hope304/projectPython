The Story of Meow Apps Exactly 16 years, 1 months and 2 days ago, I arrived in Japan. I was working as a software engineer in the financial industry. Amazed by the variety of scenes and landscapes, I started to photograph Japan as much as I can (check my instagram), and created various sites. Naturally, I created my websites using WordPress. As a developer, I was blown away by the sheer number of plugins needed to create a great website. But not only that, I was disappointed by the poor quality of the code and the lack of optimization. It felt like an uphill battle to get the results I wanted. Thatâ€™s why I decided to create my own plugins for my own use. To my surprise, they became incredibly popular, and the community encouraged me to add more features and release Pro versions. And just like that, Meow Apps was born!I still use my own plugins every day, and that drives me to keep making them better and better. I hope youâ€™ll enjoy them as much as I do! Meow Apps Meow Apps was created by Jordy Meow, a software engineer and photographer based in Tokyo. So many solutions are available for WordPress today, but of uneven quality, often oversized and not well-supported. Meow Apps aims for perfection by providing tools that will change your WordPress life for the best. Hosted by WPEngine Love their service and amazing speed!
