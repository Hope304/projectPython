Comparison based on Alliant Credit Union 3.10% APY as of the 2/22/2024 dividend declaration date vs. the bank national average savings rate of .22% APY as of 1/1/2024 sourced from National Association of Federal Credit Unions in cooperation with SNL Financial and Datatrac Corp. 19. Your first box of standard checks is free. Other check designs are available for an extra charge. Alliant checking charges no monthly maintenance or service fees. Please refer to the Alliant Fee Schedule for a list of fees. Overdraft protection is optional. You must opt in to benefit from this free service and you can unenroll at any time. Alliant's overdraft protection program honors your overdrafts on your checking account when you don’t have enough money in your Alliant checking account to cover a transaction, provided you have enough money in your Alliant Savings or Supplemental Savings Account. To do so, we automatically transfer funds from your Alliant Savings or Supplemental Savings Account to your Alliant checking account to cover your overdrafts. Overdraft protection does not cover ATM transactions. Courtesy Pay is a discretionary "courtesy" overdraft service. There is no fee to enroll in or use the Courtesy Pay service and you can unenroll at any time. To be eligible for Courtesy Pay, members must be in good standing and have an Alliant checking account that has been open for at least six months. Other eligibility factors are risk-based and determined by Alliant using internal and confidential information, including your account history. To qualify to use Courtesy Pay, eligible members must have qualifying deposits totaling at least $600 into their Alliant checking account in the previous 30 days. Standard Courtesy Pay may pay checks and ACH electronic items that would not have not cleared otherwise due to insufficient funds, up to an approved limit. The full amount of the overdraft balance will be due immediately but in no event more than 30 days from the date of the occurrence at which time Courtesy Pay privileges will be suspended and possibly terminated. If you opt in for extended coverage, Courtesy Pay may also cover everyday debit transactions on your Alliant Visa debit card that would not have cleared otherwise due to insufficient funds, up to an approved limit. See the Alliant Account Agreement and Disclosures and the Courtesy Pay Disclosure for details and the Fee Schedule for a list of fees. Courtesy Pay does not cover ATM transactions. A fee will apply if you choose to receive an account statement in paper form; refer to the Fee Schedule. To avoid the paper statement fee, log in to Alliant Online Banking to change your statement preference to eStatements. Alliant will rebate ATM fees up to $20 per month per membership account when you use your Alliant checking account Visa debit card to make a deposit, withdrawal, transfer or balance inquiry. The rebate does not apply to cash advances from Alliant Visa credit cards through ATMs nor to the Alliant Savings ATM Card and Visa International Service Assessment (ISA) fee, referenced as the foreign transaction fee on account statements. Not all ATMs accept deposits. Limitations apply. Mobile check deposit requires a camera-enabled mobile device. Data and text charges may apply. Check with your mobile service provider. APY=Annual Percentage Yield. Alliant High-Rate Checking Dividends are paid on the last day of each month to checking accountholders who have opted out of receiving paper statements (receive eStatements only) and have a recurring monthly electronic deposit to their Alliant checking account each month (e.g., a direct deposit, payroll deposit, ATM deposit, mobile check deposit or transfer from another financial institution). Otherwise, Alliant checking accounts do not earn a dividend. The 3/1/2024 High Rate Checking dividend provides an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 0.25% APY. The APY is accurate as of the 2/22/2024 dividend declaration date. Checking dividend may change after account is opened and is subject to change at any time. There is no minimum balance requirement to earn a dividend. Account is subject to approval. We may not open checking for you if you do not meet Alliant criteria. 57. APY= Annual Percentage Yield. The APY is accurate as of the 2/22/2024 dividend declaration date. A $1000.00 minimum deposit is required to open a Regular Alliant Certificate. A $75,000 minimum deposit is required to open an Alliant Jumbo Certificate. If you open an Alliant Jumbo Certificate with a minimum deposit of $75,000, but later withdraw funds from the account and bring the balance below $75,000, the Alliant Jumbo Certificate will convert to a Regular Alliant Certificate, which may pay a lower rate. You must be an Alliant member. Alliant Certificates are available as Regular Share Certificates and, Jumbo Share Certificates. Both Regular and Jumbo Certificate types are also offered as Traditional IRA Certificates, Roth IRA Certificates, and SEP IRA Certificates. In addition, prior to opening an IRA Certificate (Traditional, Roth and SEP), you must have or establish an IRA with Alliant. You may not add any additional money to your Certificate after opening. Dividends compound monthly and are paid on the last day of the month and at maturity. A penalty will be imposed for early withdrawal of any principal amount. There are no penalties for monthly dividend withdrawals. Early withdrawal penalties do apply if the Certificate is closed before the maturity date unless the Certificate funds are moved to Alliant Retirement and Investment Services. If you wish to move your Certificate funds to Alliant Retirement and Investment Services, you must wait until 7 days after your Certificate has been opened. Other exceptions to early withdrawal penalties may be allowed. Monthly dividend withdrawals are not eligible on IRA Certificates if owner is under age 59 1/2. Any monthly withdrawals or transfers reduce earnings. If you change the term of your renewed Certificate, the beneficiary(ies) need(s) to be reestablished by completing a Beneficiary Add/Delete Form. (Not applicable to IRA Certificates). The joint owner designated at the time of Certificate opening will remain as joint owner if you renew your Certificate with Alliant. Neither the primary account owner or joint owner may be a beneficiary on the Certificate account. You are not locked into a rate until you open or renew your Alliant Certificate. Alliant Certificate rates may change daily. Fees may reduce earnings on the account. 3-5 months Regular Share Certificates with a term between 3 and 5 months provide a Dividend Rate of 4.17% – Compounded Annual Percentage Yield of 4.25% APY on balances between $1,000 and $74,999.99.
