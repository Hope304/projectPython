It is a service of the Martin P. Catherwood Library (serving Cornell University's ILR School), and Cornell University Library. Research and scholarly output including journal articles, working papers, and reports have been selected for inclusion in DC@ILR by the individual departments, centers, institutes, and programs within the ILR School, and deposited by authors or the staff at the Catherwood Library. In addition, DC@ILR houses collections of digital material selected by the librarians and archivists at Catherwood. These collections were created out of a growing concern over the loss of born digital materials and grey literature and the desire to ensure access to these resources for current and future students, faculty, and researchers. We offer these digital collections as part of its ongoing mission to serve as a comprehensive information center in support of the research, instruction, and service commitments of the ILR School and Cornell community. We are committed to the long term accessibility of all items in DC@ILR: each item is assigned a persistent handle, and metadata records are maintained even for withdrawn content. There are no access restrictions for any content housed within the repository except for embargoes as required by publishers, and all content may be freely accessed by search engines. For questions, comments, and inquiries about the DC@ILR, contact the Digital Projects Group of the Catherwood Library, at catherwood-dig@cornell.edu.BrowseSubcommunities and CollectionsBy Issue DateBy AuthorBy TitleBy SubjectBy TypeSubcommunities and CollectionsBy Issue DateBy AuthorBy TitleBy SubjectBy TypeCommunities in this CommunityNow showing 1 - 7 of 7Results Per Page 1 5 10 20 40 60 80 100 Sort Options Ascending Descending Academic Departments 2113 Centers, Institutes, Programs 3418 ILR Collection 2980 Labor Research Review 277 Library 24234 Partnerships 770 Practical Technology for Archives 38Collections in this CommunityNow showing 1 - 4 of 4Results Per Page 1 5 10 20 40 60 80 100 Sort Options Ascending Descending Conflict and its Resolution in the Changing World of Work: A Conference and Special Issue Honoring David B.
