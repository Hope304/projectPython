EN Defense was wandering around EDPAX and it was tough.As expected, the rich man is different. I was playing with reflex weapons destruction and abnormal condition (・ ∀ ・) The last defense of JS was a defense while trying to divide it into a racer, right?(゜ A ﾟ;) The last is the EMC drops at only a few places remaining.10/05/23 LOKI Siege War May 23, 2010 Update after a long time ~ I'm busy on a business trip (← excuse) I can't update very much.To be honest, my personal opinion is that when the mackerel is lighter and I can't catch up with the LK with AX (myself), I lost my intention to do pure racing, and there is a decrease in the number of racers that compete.I don't understand the meaning.So it would be helpful if someone could take over the most most announcement record.↓ Appropriate GV Repo 3 consecutive weeks C5 Fort Acquisition ヽ (・ ∀ ・) ﾉ ﾉ ﾉ。。。。。Was it the first time for two consecutive weeks ('Д 丶)?This time, it seems like you were lucky and lucky.
