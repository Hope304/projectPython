It plays a vital role in setting the overall tone of your website, and ensures a great user experience.

Thousands of Text Fonts Text fonts are a crucial part of your branding design, but ironically, this aspect of branding is usually overlooked. You can create excellent illustrations, images, and other graphic content but if the font on your site or in your branded assets is less than rocking, it could easily turn a reader away. When designing your brand identity, you must use a consistent set of fonts, each with a specific purpose. Make sure the fonts are legible. They are needed for headings, titles, subtitles, and body text in any collateral or online materials. Consider the weight and size of each font, along with the style. Make sure that the different choices you select are harmonious with one another. Choose a style that is different from your competitors and translates the personality of your brand. And, most importantly, the font you select should always be easy on the eyes. Nobody likes working with copy that requires squinting to read.

About FontSpace Founded in 2006, FontSpace is a designer-centered font website that has quick customizable previews and hassle-free downloads. Every font is added and categorized by a real person. Each font is reviewed by a FontSpace moderator, checked for font quality issues, and licenses are verified. With an ever-increasing amount of unethical font websites available, we strive to be THE source for legitimate and clearly licensed fonts. Whether you are a professional graphics designer, crafter, hobbyist, teacher, or student, we hope you enjoy the fonts here. At FontSpace, we pay attention to the fine print. As such, we only provide fonts that are licensed and fully authorized for use. However, there are a lot of font websites operating under false pretenses and, unfortunately, offer fonts that are not actually licensed. As a result, there is a potential for lawsuits or other legal action. To avoid this, be sure to use FontSpace for all your font needs. FontSpace has a mission devoted to keeping people from experiencing font licensing issues. We aim to be a space that inspires creativity across the internet. In addition, we also believe that creativity can flourish in a space devoted to ethical practices and solutions.
