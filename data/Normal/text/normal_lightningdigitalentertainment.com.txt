June, 2023 - We are honored & humbled to continue providing production services for The Wounded Blue, a Las Vegas based National assistance organization for Injured & Disabled Law Enforcement Officers. In this new short film, we tell disabled former Bay City, Texas Police Officer Mike Jarmin’s story. An on duty accident in 2008 left Mike catastrophically injured, as he sustained a traumatic brain injury, multiple broken bones, and an injury to his left leg that later required amputation. Now 15 years later, the prosthetic leg he was initially provided is unserviceable. With nowhere to turn, the Jarmin family contacted Randy Sutton & The Wounded Blue for assistance. What happened next would change the Jarmin family’s lives forever.
