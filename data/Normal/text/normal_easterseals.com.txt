Zip Code Click to search by zip code The Latest From Our Blog Love is Advocating for Accessible Public Transit February 28, 2024 By Mike Ervin Every once in a while, I have what I call a “green-bus nightmare”: I’m out… By Mike Ervin Every once in a while, I have what I call a “green-bus nightmare”: I’m out and about and all of a sudden, a public transit bus goes by and it’s painted green and there are three big steps inside the front door — so it’s inaccessible as hell for someone who uses a wheelchair, like me. The public transit buses in Chicago are much different today. They’re painted white, red and blue and inside the front door is a ramp that flips out onto the curb when the driver flips a switch so a wheelchair user can roll right in. So in my nightmare, I’m mad as a hornet when I see the green bus go by. I say to myself, “What the hell is this? I thought those inaccessible buses were long gone!” And then I wake up and realize it was just a bad dream. But that’s how things were in Chicago prior to 1990, when the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law. The ADA requires that all public transit buses put into service must be wheelchair accessible. But without any federal mandate like that, there wasn’t a single accessible bus in the street fleet of the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). You can imagine how frustrating that was for anyone who didn’t have the physical ability to board CTA buses. It was as if the CTA system didn’t even exist. To give people today some context on that situation, I ask people to imagine that the entire CTA system is suddenly and indefinitely shut down! How would that impact their lives? How would they get around? How isolated, abandoned and angry would they feel? This is why I became an activist. I graduated from college in 1978 and I was living with my mother and sister in the house in which I was raised. The house was on a main street and a green CTA bus passed by several times a day. Come about 1983 or so, I began hearing word-of-mouth tales from other disabled folks about a group of disabled activists in Denver, Colorado who called themselves American Disabled for Accessible Public Transportation (ADAPT). There were public transit buses with wheelchair lifts in operation in Denver mostly because ADAPT organized aggressive protests where people in wheelchairs did things like surround inaccessible buses that were on the street waiting at intersections. The protesters wouldn’t move for several hours so the bus couldn’t move either. And sometimes ADAPTers even got arrested for protesting like that. Right around that same time, a man from Chicago named Kent Jones, who used a wheelchair, went to Denver to attend an ADAPT organizing training for people from around the country. When he returned, he called a meeting for the purpose of organizing a local chapter of ADAPT. I attended the meeting because I was mad. Hearing about the exploits of Denver ADAPT forever changed my perspective on those green buses that passed my house daily. I now saw them as an essential public facility as much as city hall or the library. Thus, I was mad at myself that I wasn’t as mad a lot sooner as I was now about what the inaccessibility of that public facility meant. It meant that if I wanted to go somewhere, I either had to spend a lot of money purchasing a vehicle and adapting it to be accessible, spend a lot of money hiring an accessible vehicle such as a med-i-car, to take me there or just forget about it and not go. But if my neighbors who weren’t wheelchair users wanted to go somewhere, all they had to do was wait at the bus stop. And that meant that those who designed the CTA thought that disabled people like me never could or should use it. The ADAPT principle of direct-action protest says that you take your demands directly to the person or entity that has the power to meet your demands. In our case, that was the seven-member CTA board of directors. Four are appointed by the mayor of Chicago and three are appointed by the governor of Illinois. So for our first action, we attended one of their monthly public board meetings where all of their decisions are made. We presented our demands and the first one was that every bus that they ordered from now on must be equipped with a wheelchair lift. We disrupted the meeting with chanting and noisemakers to demonstrate our resolve. ADAPT protesters during the lead up to the passage of the ADA. But the CTA board voted unanimously not to include lifts on any new buses. So we continued disrupting their meetings, blocking traffic in our wheelchairs so buses couldn’t get through and staging similarly aggressive but nonviolent protests. Sometimes we got arrested. We also pursued a discrimination lawsuit against the CTA with the help of pro-bono lawyers. The lawsuit eventually went to trial and in January of 1988, the judge who presided over the trial ruled that CTA illegally discriminated against the disabled under state law by not having any mainline accessibility. Shortly after that, the CTA board, which now had a member who was a wheelchair user who was an ardent ADAPT supporter and had been appointed by Mayor Hafold Washington, voted 6-1 to equip future buses with wheelchair lifts. And shortly after that, the ADA was signed. When I reflect on all this, I feel our campaign to make public transit accessible was motivated by love — love for ourselves as people with disabilities and love for the disabled community. It’s true that we simply wanted more freedom to travel independently. But there was much more to it than that. It was so important to us because we were insulted that we were being denied a basic freedom just because we were disabled. We loved and respected ourselves and each other too much to accept the notion that we deserved and should settle for less because of our disabilities. We deserved to be accommodated and included and we wouldn’t take no for an answer. We also hoped that bringing about this change would pay dividends far into the future, not just by making it easier for further generators of disabled people to get from one place to another but by lessening the debilitating sting of disability stigma, which is so often used to rationalize exclusion. The more we are a natural element of the daily routines of people whose lives aren’t affected by disability, the less they will be inclined to believe that we don’t deserve to be among them. And hopefully that has made and will make it easier for others to break down the many other walls of disability segregation. A famous quote by Che Guevara is, “the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality.” Regardless of one’s opinion of Che Guevara, he was sure right about that.

Beyond Compliance: Fostering Accessibility, Inclusion, and Cultural Humility February 19, 2024 By Andrea Jennings Community Love: Cultural Humility and Accessible Solutions In the tapestry of hu… By Andrea Jennings Community Love: Cultural Humility and Accessible Solutions In the tapestry of human experience, accessibility is intertwined with love, shaping the fabric of a compassionate and inclusive society. One example is disability justice advocate Mia Mingus, who coined the term “access intimacy,” which describes the feeling when someone who is not necessarily from the disabled community understands your access needs. As February unfolds with the celebration of Valentine’s Day, it’s an opportune time to reflect on how we all share love, express love, and foster accessibility, extending the significance beyond mere observance to embody a lifestyle of inclusion, cultural humility, and genuine care. From childhood, I was fortunate to learn the true essence of love from my mother, particularly during Valentine’s Day. It wasn’t just about exchanging chocolates and flowers and embodying Agape love—selfless, unconditional, and inclusive. My mother’s teachings transcended romantic notions, emphasizing the importance of spreading love beyond our immediate circles. Together, we embarked on a tradition of making Valentine’s cards for friends and everyone in my class, ensuring no one felt left out. This act of kindness extended to our family members, neighbors, and anyone who crossed our path. Through these gestures, my mother instilled in me the belief that love knows no bounds and should be shared generously with all. Reflecting on my upbringing, I realize the parallels between love, accessibility, and cultural humility. Accessibility is not merely a privilege or favor but a fundamental aspect of humanity. Just as we wouldn’t frame love as a favor granted to select individuals, accessibility should not be viewed as something we should be grateful for. It is a basic human need and a right for all individuals. Fostering accessibility is a manifestation of love in action. It removes physical, social, and systemic barriers that hinder full societal participation. Whether implementing wheelchair ramps, providing signage, or offering assistive technologies, accessibility ensures everyone has equity and equal opportunities to engage, participate, and succeed. Cultural humility serves as a crucial aspect of fostering accessibility and inclusion. It empowers us to recognize our own biases and privileges while actively seeking to respect the experiences of others. By approaching interactions with humility, openness, and a willingness to learn, we create spaces where diversity is celebrated and everyone feels valued and included. Romantic Love: Challenging and Removing Microaggressions and Assumptions In addition to advocating for ourselves, Disabled individuals often face micro aggressive comments and assumptions when it comes to romantic relationships. Society’s narrow perceptions of disability can lead to intrusive questions and misguided beliefs about the nature of our relationships. Microaggressions can manifest in various forms, such as asking personal questions that would not be directed at non-disabled individuals or making assumptions about the dynamics of our relationships based on our disabilities. For example, comments like “you’re so lucky to have a partner despite your disability” overlook the possibility that both partners contribute equally to the relationship or that the non-disabled partner may also benefit from the relationship. Flower photography by Andrea These microaggressions not only perpetuate harmful stereotypes but also undermine the autonomy and agency of disabled individuals in romantic relationships. Instead of being seen as capable of experiencing love and intimacy on their own terms, disabled individuals are often objectified or pitied, reinforcing the notion of their otherness. Challenging these microaggressions in our community and the media requires a commitment to dismantling ableism and fostering genuine inclusivity in all aspects of society. Changing those perceptions is one way we shift paradigms. Self-Love: Being Kind To Ourselves While Advocating Advocating for ourselves in a world that often overlooks or dismisses our needs can be exhausting. Not only do we face external barriers to accessibility, but we also frequently find ourselves in the position of having to justify our disabilities and access requirements. This constant need to explain and defend our existence can affect our mental and emotional well-being. While advocating for our rights and pushing against the status quo, it’s crucial to remember the importance of self-love. This means being kind and compassionate to ourselves. Self-love entails acknowledging our worthiness and deservingness of respect and accommodation without needing to justify or apologize for our disabilities. While in college, I asked for a specific accommodation, and that instructor replied, “oh yes, I know you want this to be easy-peasy.” Not only was this comment unnecessary, but it was condescending in nature and an example of microaggression that I often encountered. After these constant assumptions, it is important to remind ourselves of our worth. Embracing self-love while advocating for ourselves is an act of self-preservation and a radical resistance against ableism and discrimination. It allows us to reclaim our narratives and assert our agency in spaces that often seek to marginalize us and not recognize our autonomy. Advocating for accessibility and recognizing our independence becomes pivotal in this context. Self-love also involves setting boundaries and prioritizing our well-being. It means recognizing when to rest and recharge and not feeling guilty for prioritizing self-care. Integrating the understanding of the spoon theory offers valuable insight into managing energy levels for those with chronic illnesses or disabilities, reinforcing the importance of self-care and advocating for our well-being. Within this framework, acknowledging the nature of energy reserves and learning to pace activities enables individuals to prioritize their well-being and cultivate a sustainable approach to self-care. Moreover, self-love empowers us to challenge internalized ableism and embrace our disabilities as integral parts of our identities. Instead of viewing our disabilities as something we need to change, we can celebrate them as unique aspects of who we are and understand it is the barriers that need to change. This allows us to embrace our authenticity and cultivate a sense of empowerment and pride in ourselves. In conclusion, prioritizing accessibility and cultivating love in various spheres — community love, romantic love, and self-love — is vital for fostering inclusivity and empowerment. By collectively prioritizing accessibility, challenging microaggressions, and promoting nurturing self-compassion, we construct a world where every individual’s worth and uniqueness are celebrated.

Access and Inclusion: Acts of Love in the Disability Community February 13, 2024 By Alicia Krage Since moving in with my boyfriend last year, I’ve thought a lot about the various wa… By Alicia Krage Since moving in with my boyfriend last year, I’ve thought a lot about the various ways I can show love, especially around this time of year. We’re often thinking about love this month as Valentine’s Day approaches. I’ve learned that showing love, especially in a relationship, could mean accommodating your partner’s disability, or learning how your disability coincides with your relationship. It’s important to create a space of acceptance and inclusion while also addressing the other person’s access needs. It’s in these simple acts that I feel show the most love because it addresses that, yes, we are both blind, but this doesn’t have to be a defining factor — as people or as part of our relationship. This comes into play when planning trips, too. For example, Juan and I are taking a trip to San Antonio in a few months and, while it’s not a far trip, it’s our first solo trip together. This means making accessible travel plans, as well as researching accessible touristy activities we can do. Juan is really into artsy things, so we’re looking into tactile art museums that we’d be able to enjoy. I think dating with a disability allows us all to become open minded about different ways of doing things and different accommodations that can be made. Alicia and her partner, Juan This could apply to platonic relationships as well, which is something I’ve thought about immensely since relocating from Chicago to Houston. I remember a conversation I had with my mom on my last night in my hometown. She asked me what I was most nervous about, and the answer came easily: “Making friends. Because making friends as an adult is hard.” Almost a year later, I realize that wasn’t anything I needed to worry about. Aside from the friends I’d made during previous visits, I only have a few new friends here, but that’s okay. I like my circle small. I met my closest friend Desiree at a book club. I found it on Facebook, actually, because how else do people meet outside of college or work? I didn’t know. She posted asking if anyone was interested in joining one, so I responded. We messaged here and there and swapped numbers. Closer to the date of the first meeting, I told her that I’m blind and please look out for me during the first meeting because I wouldn’t know where to find anyone. Unphased, she said, “Absolutely! I’ll help in any way I can!” Since then, our friendship grew outside of book club and evolved into constant texting, exchanging book recommendations and exploring various local coffee shops and going out for the occasional brunch. I know it seems trivial to say, but I’ve never felt like “her blind friend.” I’m just her friend who needs help sometimes. She’ll let me know what type of place we’re going to — if you just walk up to the counter and order or if it’s a sit-down place — in case I arrive first. If we’re going out for a meal, she’ll always ask if I need her to read me the menu. When I went to her house the weekend before Valentine’s Day for a “Galentine’s Day” get-together, we played games, but they were simple enough that I could definitely participate. I constantly feel loved in our friendship because she has always provided me a space to be myself, to advocate for my needs without feeling like I’m asking for too much, and meeting my access needs. My family has always been good at this, too. It’s in the way they adapt card games if necessary, or plan accessible activities during family vacations. They also recently started activating audio description when we watch TV shows or movies. My mom always said that the people audio describing know what information is important, so it’s better to have that feature turned on. I felt weird about it at first because I thought it would annoy them and it would be hard for them to tune out. But they assured me several times that they didn’t mind. And so that’s how we’ve been doing things. I’m fortunate to feel so loved in all of my relationships — romantic, platonic, and familial — because my blindness has been something to accommodate at times but nothing that has ever felt like an inconvenience. And I’ve learned that those are the people you surround yourself with. Enjoying time with family comes easy because I know it’s second nature to them to adapt things. Enjoying time with friends, old and new, comes easily because they’ll accommodate me too, and if they are new to this and don’t know how, they’ll ask. I’ve assured them that if they ever have questions about my blindness, it’s always okay to ask. I can’t expect them to provide a safe space for me if I don’t do the same for them. By providing a safe space for them to ask questions, they do so and accommodate as necessary — and provide a safe space for me, too. All of this has taught me what love really is. A lot of people think acts of love are these big, grand gestures showcased in TV shows, movies, and books, but it’s those little things that really matter. I used to be stuck in that comparison trap in relationships and wanting my partner to show me the kind of love I read about, or saw in all those rom-coms, but I’ve learned to stop looking for that because that’s all fiction. And I’ve learned to truly appreciate those who show love in the disabled community by educating themselves on our disability, whether someone is blind, deaf or hard-of-hearing, uses a wheelchair, etc. I have friends with all types of disabilities which helps me understand what love is to them, too. It’s educating and asking questions, wanting to learn. It’s learning their story and any accommodations they may need if you choose to meet up, and making things accessible to them. It’s finding audio described media, or wheelchair accessible restaurants, or providing the closed-captioning headset in movie theaters. There are many ways to show love to people with disabilities, and it’s often in the smallest ways that mean the most. Alicia Krage is a graduate of Northern Illinois University. She relocated to Houston, Texas in early 2023 where she found a great community of people with disabilities. She has a passion for writing, centering her posts on advocacy, inclusivity, and relationships as a totally blind person.

Accessible Transportation: A Lifeline to Connect Individuals to Their Communities January 30, 2024 By Andrea Jennings Accessible transportation serves as the lifeline for many individuals, fostering … By Andrea Jennings Accessible transportation serves as the lifeline for many individuals, fostering connections to communities, enabling access to essential services, and promoting independence. We will explore the impact of an accessible transportation process for all and the importance of accessible design in transportation services, from booking transportation, accessible drop-off and pick-up locations, and seamless connections to arriving at destinations with undamaged mobility aids. The Seamless Transition: A Personal Anecdote As someone who uses multiple mobility aids, I have experienced the impact of navigating different modes of transportation with different mobility aids. I use leg braces, canes, and walkers, depending on my muscle weakness and fatigue level. I often use a wheelchair for traveling as it preserves my energy and reduces my risk of falling. I vividly recall a journey emphasizing the importance of an accessible, seamless transition for transportation. On my way to an essential conference in my industry to connect me to my peers and the community, I faced barriers due to a lack of communication between the transportation company’s staff members. Boarding the train, my intended mode of transportation for that day, was accessible, but connecting to a bus ride through that carrier posed potential barriers. Once I exited the train to transfer to the bus, I could not find any clear instructions or signage to tell me where I could safely wait for the connecting bus and where the bus would arrive. If it had not been for my personal care attendant, who could track down staff members eventually, I might have missed the bus. I should have been able to travel independently with accessibility procedures integrated into the process of transferring from the same carrier’s train to their bus connection. This process could be more seamless, benefiting everyone. This is a great time to mention that hiring persons with lived experience in leadership positions as executives is essential to ensure that different perspectives are included when planning or restructuring designs. Accessible transportation ensures that individuals can move from one mode to another effortlessly and facilitates a sense of connection within the community. Time Constraints and Accessible Share Rides A colleague and friend, project manager Ushonda Wilson, highlighted a significant issue within accessible share rides – time constraints. Ushonda explained that she had to leave a work-related community event early because her mode of transportation, which included a train and a ride-share service, only ensured accessible services up to a specific time of day. Time restraints create barriers because Ushonda was excluded from full participation in an important work-community and career-enhancing event. While some of these ride-share services are cost effective, these services often impose strict time limits, hindering individuals with disabilities from thoroughly enjoying community or career-related events. By shedding light on these limitations, we can advocate for more flexible and inclusive policies allowing everyone to travel to work and participate in community activities without undue restrictions. Drop-Off and Pick-Up Stations: Signage is Essential Ride-share services play a pivotal role in accessible transportation. Well-defined drop-off and pick-up stations make a significant difference in the effectiveness of these services. Clear signage ensures that designated areas highlight and promote a smooth, accessible, stress-free travel experience. Shelter and Safety While Waiting While waiting for transportation, shelter and safety provisions are integral to the transportation experience. Covered waiting areas protect from the elements, ensuring that rain or harsh weather conditions do not become barriers to accessibility. Again, this is a feature everyone can benefit from; extreme weather conditions aggravate many disabilities. By addressing these concerns, we create an environment that prioritizes the well-being of all passengers. Training Staff on Accessibility Measures: Understanding Disability Etiquette A key aspect of accessible transportation is ensuring that the drivers and the entire staff, internally and externally, are well trained to address accessibility measures successfully and adequately assist individuals with disabilities. This training should encompass awareness of different disabilities, sensitivity to diverse access requirements as we are not a monolith, and the ability to identify and support passengers requiring additional assistance beyond compliance. Design improvements that allow us to stay in or use our mobility aids or provide the proper storage of our mobility aids while on board is crucial. There are too many instances where mobility aids have been damaged during travel. These changes not only affect our connection to the community because we fear traveling due to the concern of our mobility aids being damaged, but this affects our health and can be a matter of life and death, as it did in the case of Disability advocate Engracia Figueroa. By doing so, transportation providers create a more accessible and inclusive experience for all. Contingency Plans for Transportation Companies Contingency plans are essential in the realm of accessible transportation. Companies should establish protocols for unexpected situations, ensuring that individuals with disabilities are not left stranded or facing undue difficulties. A solution is to address unforeseen challenges such as vehicle breakdowns, road closures, or any other disruptions that may impact the smooth operation of services. Also, disseminate these contingency plans in an accessible format in plain language for all to comprehend. Well-Trained Staff Across Industries In addition to transportation companies, various industries play a role in ensuring accessibility. Hotels offering shuttle services, public transportation agencies, and other service providers must invest in training their staff on properly addressing and integrating accessibility throughout their company’s infrastructure. This approach extends the principles of accessible transportation beyond the vehicles themselves, creating a holistic and supportive environment for all. Connecting to Employment and Essential Services Accessible transportation is not merely about convenience; it is a gateway to employment opportunities and essential services. For many individuals with disabilities, reliable transportation is the key to accessing workplaces, medical facilities, and educational institutions. By highlighting the role of accessible transportation in connecting people to these vital aspects of life, we underscore its broader societal impact. Universal Design and Human-Centered Design for Inclusive Transportation A universal design approach to accessible transportation benefits society as a whole. Ramps, wider aisles, and other accessibility features make transportation more human centered and user friendly for all, including parents with strollers, aging adults, and individuals with temporary injuries. Embracing universal design principles enhances the overall accessibility of transportation systems and reinforces the idea that inclusivity benefits everyone. Promoting Independence Through Accessible Transportation Perhaps the most profound impact of accessible transportation is the independence it provides. By removing barriers to mobility, these services empower everyone to lead more fulfilling lives, participate actively in their communities, and pursue opportunities that were previously out of reach. Accessible transportation is a service and a catalyst for our future, prioritizing accessibility and serving all communities. Conclusion As we work towards a more accessible future, let us recognize how accessible transportation is vital in enriching lives and strengthening the bonds within every community. Accessible transportation is not just a means of getting from point A to point B; it is the lifeline that connects individuals to their communities. By prioritizing accessible design in all aspects of transportation, from the moment a person books their travel to the moment they arrive at their destination, we can create an accessible and inclusive transportation system that helps all connect to their communities. The journey toward accessibility requires ongoing collaboration, communication, and a commitment to creating a more connected, inclusive, and accessible society.

Why We Need Accessible Cities January 25, 2024 By Mids Meinberg The United States is a car-centered culture. While increasing work-from-home and de… By Mids Meinberg The United States is a car-centered culture. While increasing work-from-home and delivery options do increase the viability of staying at home, there are still a wide variety of tasks that require a person to leave the home. In most of the country, leaving the home means driving to reach that other location. Many disabled people, including myself, are unable to drive because of our disabilities. This cuts us off from so many aspects of culture and life and forces dependence on others for many vital aspects of survival, like medical visits. The idea of the “walkable city” has become an increasingly popular discussion in online spaces. Essentially, a walkable city is a way of building communities so that all necessary facilities for employment, survival, and entertainment can be reached within a fifteen-minute walk from any given residence. These sorts of integrated communities are more common in Europe. When I lived in a German village, for instance, I was able to reach anything within that village with a short walk, despite living on its outskirts, ranging from cafes to bakeries to the village center. Perhaps more importantly though, I could easily get to a bus stop. Making walkable cities would require vast overhauls in zoning regulations and existing infrastructure and is not an especially likely outcome, at least in the short term. More achievable, though, is enhanced public transit networks. Where I live now in the suburbs of New Jersey, an area unusually dense in public-transit options for the suburbs, I am a three-mile walk away from the nearest public node, and that is too far for me to be able to walk — even if the route from my home to that bus stop was safe for pedestrians, which it is not! Denser public transit nodes might be more expensive for municipalities, but the benefits they offer for all citizens cannot be understated. Cars are extremely expensive and force most people to go into heavy debt to acquire one. If people were able to get to where they need to go without driving, then they would be able to more comfortably manage their finances, even for nondisabled people! It is an especially pressing matter for disabled people, though, as a wide variety of disabilities prevent driving. For me, a combination of low vision and anxiety make driving impossible. For others, mobility disabilities can prevent the ability to drive. Indeed, the high level of danger involved in driving should make people more interested in public transit options to get from place to place. Any degree of driving skill less than master makes the roads less safe for everyone involved, not just the driver. According to a study by the National Library of Medicine, cars are 4 times as likely to have accidents than buses. Serious injuries were twenty-eight times more likely for car users than bus passengers! In addition to the safety functions, having more buses means fewer vehicles on the road which reduces traffic for everyone. While there are obviously costs involved in expanding a bus network, the benefits far outweigh these costs. Being able to connect to a broader community allows people to live fuller, more engaging lives, not only through access to services but also access to employment. The vast majority of entry-level work positions in the United States require access to regular transportation, which is a major impediment for disabled people finding work. I personally have struggled to find work thanks to my inability to drive, my inability to access places that would be willing to hire me. While work-from-home (WFH) jobs experienced a surge during the height of the pandemic, workplaces using WFH have begun to decrease in number since then. In addition, WFH jobs almost universally require access to higher education. Entry-level positions for people without a college degree are almost always in person. While many of these positions might be inaccessible for some disabled people, there are plenty (like basic office jobs) that most disabled people can do, but only if they could get to the office. Larger cities typically already have some public-transit networks in place, but even these networks could become more broadly accessible. The subways of New York City are infamous for their expansiveness but also their corresponding complexity. Simpler or more abstract subway maps could be helpful in increasing navigability for people who struggle to understand the existing map. In addition, almost every subway station in New York City is not wheelchair accessible, blocking wheelchair users from using them safely or at all. While there are some subway stations with elevators, these elevators frequently break down due to lack of maintenance. Similar problems exist in other cities with subways or elevated rails. In addition, some buses can be very complicated in using their wheelchair accessible functions, to the point that some bus drivers are not educated in their function. Expanding awareness and demonstrating usage of the ramp and lift functions would go a long way in helping to make sure that wheelchair users are more integrated into our pubic transit networks. Trolley systems can be a functional alternative to subways or elevated rail, and since they don’t require a change in elevation, they are inherently more accessible. That said, trolley lines do take up space on the road, and thus are less traffic efficient than subways or elevated rails. They are relatively rare as well, with buses tending to fill in for the same role. Trolleys, despite their lack of flexibility, are even safer than buses, are quieter, and pull power from the grid rather than requiring fuel, making them significantly more cost effective in the long run. Urban spaces with larger land area could truly benefit from the inclusion of trolleys into their public transit networks. When I lived in Germany, I made several trips to the Hague in The Netherlands as part of my social studies curriculum. The freedom to be able to catch a trolley from just down the block from our hotel and ride it all the way to the centers of commerce and entertainment and culture in the city, along with my classmates, and to feel like I was truly immersed in the city despite not being able to drive, is a treasured memory that I will never forget. Walking down the boardwalk with the frigid air coming off of the North Sea, salty in the early evening air, and knowing that the hotel was a short trip away in a warm trolley was something only available because of the amazing public transit options in the city. Let’s work to make more public transit available for everyone. Mids Meinberg is a writer and game designer working out of New Jersey.
