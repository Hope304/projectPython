SimpleBits® Fonts Goods Club Books Blog About Hi, I’m Dan Cederholm. SimpleBits® is my tiny design studio, type foundry, and goods shop. We make letters and numbers (and goods with those letters and numbers on them) for people like you. Handmade in Salem, Massachusetts. SimpleBits has been my design studio and hypertext home for over 20 years. At times, I’m available for select logo design projects. Previously, I co-founded Dribbble. I also infrequently write here on the blog, take photos, share short thoughts on design and the universe, and occassionally record a podcast. I’m a U.S. Coast Guard-licensed Captain and quite possibly the world’s worst fisherman.

Cloth-bound with mid-century aesthetics and arguably-artistic doodles.
