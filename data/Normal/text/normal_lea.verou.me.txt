Home • Lea Verou Lea Verou Home Blog Projects Speaking Publications Press About Repo Hi, I’m Lea and I love making things. Ι design new web technologies implemented in browsers, and tools used by millions of developers. As a W3C TAG member, I review web technology proposals to ensure they benefit the Web. I’ve done HCI research at MIT on democratizing web development, earning me a PhD. I speak, teach, and write, including a bestselling book with O’Reilly, dubbed “Best CSS book”. I often blog about all this – and more!
