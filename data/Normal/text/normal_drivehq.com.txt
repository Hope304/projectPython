It not only offers more and better features, but also is much easier to manage and costs far less. Cloud Storage Cloud Storage is the same as Online Storage or Internet Storage. Users can easily upload / download files on DriveHQ cloud storage system using DriveHQ FileManager, web browser, FTP Service or DriveHQ WebDAV cloud drive. Users can remotely access files from anywhere at any time. Cloud File Server DriveHQ Cloud File Server works just like a local file server. You can drag and drop files / folders using FileManager, FTP or WebDAV cloud mapped drive; you can directly edit a remote file and save back; you can manage sub-users and sub-groups; you can share folders to different users with various permissions. Cloud Backup You can get rid of USB backup, DVD backup or tape backup. DriveHQ Cloud Backup is much better and more affordable than traditional backup solutions. You can backup / restore files from anywhere at any time without carrying a backup device. Also because it is offsite backup, it can survive any major disasters. Cloud Computing DriveHQ Cloud computing is different. You can use our cloud service from anywhere, you don't need to relegate your PCs into dumb terminals. DriveHQ cloud computing extends your desktop software into the cloud. You can use your familiar sofware (e.g. MS Office, PDF, Photoshop, etc.) with our cloud service. Online Storage DriveHQ Online Storage has much more features than other online storage services. It is far more than just online storage, It supports all modern web browsers and FTP client software; it has a native client program DriveHQ FileManager and can map a cloud drive. It is seamlessly integrated with DriveHQ Cloud IT system. Cloud Drive Mapping You can map DriveHQ online storage as a WebDAV cloud drive, such as Z: drive. No software needs to be installed. It is extremely simple. If you have a lot of files or very large files, you can also use DriveHQ FileManager or FTP. Remote Data Access Using DriveHQ Online Storage service, you can access your data from anywhere using DriveHQ.com website, DriveHQ FileManager client, FTP or WebDAV cloud drive mapping. Business users can easily access their data from multiple offices, hotel or home. Secure File Storage DriveHQ online storage service is designed to be extremely secure and reliable. It is managed by professionals, colocated in a high-end data center with full redundancy and 24x7 onsite security. Your files are secure and private. Drop Box Folder DriveHQ Drop Box folder enables anybody to upload files to you securely without having to sign up and without hassle. Just provide your drop box URL, and anybody can drop files into it. Files in a drop box can only be accessed by yourself. FTP Service FTP stands for "File Transfer Protocol". It is the most popular method for transferring files to different locations. Almost all platforms support FTP. FTP is efficient, reliable and easy-to-use. It can be used to transfer very large files / folders. DriveHQ offers standard FTP features plus more advanced features at a very low cost. Setup FTP Server To setup, configure and secure an FTP server is never easy. FTP server may pose serious security threat as you must open a lot of network ports; managing FTP accounts and set permission is also a headache. DriveHQ FTP server saves you time and money, you can set it up in just a few minutes. FTP Server Hosting DriveHQ FTP Server Hosting service includes FTP server software, hardware and hosting. It is extremely easy to setup. Compared with other FTP hosting service, DriveHQ FTP service not only is a standard FTP hosting service, but also is seamlessly integrated with other DriveHQ cloud services. FTP Backup You can backup files / folders to DriveHQ FTP server from any platforms. Files backed up to DriveHQ FTP server are secure and private. You can access these files using DriveHQ FTP, DriveHQ.com website or DriveHQ FileManager client software. FTP Security Camera DriveHQ can protect your data and your physical assets. Our subsidiary CameraFTP is a leading Cloud Surveillance, storage, recording and home security/ monitoring service provider. Online Backup DriveHQ Online Backup can replace your local backup solution. You can setup real-time backup tasks and scheduled backup tasks. It has a lot of features, such as incremental backup, backup locked files, file versioning, backup multiple PCs, backup servers, etc. Cloud Data Backup You might have a very good backup solution in-house. However, in-house backup is inherently less secure / reliable than offsite backup. In case of major disasters, such as fire, flood, theft, virus, etc. both the source files and the backup files can be destroyed as they are in the same location. Offsite backup keeps your backup data in a different location, thus it is far more reliable. Online Email Backup You can backup emails using either DriveHQ Online Backup or DriveHQ EmailManager. Using DriveHQ Online Backup, you can backup the entire Outlook PST files or other email data folder. Using DriveHQ EmailManager, it is far more efficient as it can incrementally backup emails and contacts one by one and it only backs up new emails. Remote Backup In-house backup such as tape backup is not flexible. You can only backup your data when you are in the same location. DriveHQ Online Backup is different. You can backup / restore your files & folders from any remote locations. No backup device or media is required. Business Backup You can automatically backup servers and databases in your company; employees can also backup their PCs, laptops and MACs. Using DriveHQ group account service, you can allocate storage space and download bytes to your sub-users. All sub-users are treated as premium users. They can access backed-up files online from anywhere. Business Email Hosting Email service is very important to any business. There are a lot of free email hosting services; however, for business, you need something better. You don't have to pay a lot to setup Exchange server or limit yourself to webmail only. DriveHQ email service is designed for SMBs. It supports SMTP/POP3/IMAP4/webmail and custom domain. You can also create group accounts. SMTP, POP & IMAP SMTP is the standard protocol for sending emails; POP and IMAP are the standard protocols for retrieving emails. Most email client software (incl. Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express) supports SMTP, POP and IMAP. POP3 is usually used for downloading emails to local; IMAP can keep all emails on server and automatically sync local and remote email boxes. DriveHQ email server supports all 3 protocols. Advanced Email Features DriveHQ email server supports SMTP,POP3 & IMAP4; it also supports SSL. It has advanced features such as: Auto Reply, Auto Forward, Mailing List, etc. It supports custom email domains and group account service. You can easily manage your email accounts online. Outlook & Mobile Email DriveHQ email service can be accessed using almost any email client software / device, such as Outlook, Outlook Express, iPhone, Android, Blackberry and Windows Mobile, etc. Emails can be kept on server so that you can download emails from multiple computers / devices. Using IMAP, you can also sync your local and remote emails. Email Backup You can use DriveHQ Online Backup to backup emails. However, if you use Outlook / Outlook Express, then using DriveHQ EmailManager client software is much more efficient. You can drag-n-drop upload / download emails and contacts; you can setup automatic backup tasks to backup your emails and contacts to DriveHQ webmail. Advanced Features DriveHQ offers a lot of high-end business features, such as Group Account service, custom domain web / email / FTP hosting, folder synchronization, remote file sharing and collaboration, Active Directory Integration, Full-Text search, etc. Group Folder Sharing You can create folders in your own account, then share different folders to different users with different permissions. You can also share folders to sub-groups and contact groups and set different permissions. The same folder can also be shared again with different permissions. Thus, multiple users can collaborate online. Folder Synchronization Using DriveHQ FileManager, you can select a folder and click Synchronize to create a sync-ed folder. You can sync folders on different computers to the same remote folder, thus you can synchronize multiple computers. You can also sync folders of multiple users to the same group shared folder, thus you can sync folders of multiple users.
