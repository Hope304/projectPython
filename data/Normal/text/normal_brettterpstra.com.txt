Mar 02, 2024 [Tweet : Mastodon] I’ve created the initial round of merchandise for the Dimspirations Store. I know my sense of humor isn’t for everyone, which is why this whole project is on a different site. I’ve started with some of my personal favorites as tees, mugs, and a 2024 calendar. The collection will grow over time (it’s print-on-demand, no cost to me to expand the selection). I’ll also adjust pricing based on feedback. I think the prices are pretty competitive based on what I’ve spent on merch myself. I’m using Sellfy for the printing and delivery. I’ve used Spring in the past and checked out Printful and Cotton Bureau, but Sellfy seemed like the best solution with the most competitive pricing. I already paid for a 1-year package, so let’s hope it works out. If it does, I’ll probably relaunch the BrettTerpstra.com (Lab) merchandise there as well. Please do check out the store, and if you like what you see, toss a couple bucks my way. And if you don’t see what you want, be sure to upvote your favorites Dimspirations by clicking the devil below each one. If you have special requests, of course let me know. I’ll admit, this one is my favorite: The Black Ink giveaway winner! Mar 01, 2024 [Tweet : Mastodon] The Black Ink giveaway has ended, and I have a winner to announce! The winners!

How to Compose Reminder Emails [Sponsor] Feb 29, 2024 [Tweet : Mastodon] Thanks to Sanebox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! This one is longer than the usual sponsored post, but full of great tips whether you use SaneBox or not (but you should!). Effective communication is key in the workplace. With it, we can complete tasks on time and meet sales goals. Yet, essential messages can sometimes get lost in our busy inboxes. This is where reminder emails come into play—they serve as gentle nudges to keep tasks on track without being overly intrusive. Crafting a reminder email that is polite, clear, and actionable requires finesse. Luckily, these best practices and examples can help you write an effective reminder email that helps you achieve your goals without sounding rude. 1. Begin with a Polite Greeting Start your reminder email with a courteous greeting to set a positive tone. Whether you’re addressing a colleague, client, or team member, a friendly salutation can go a long way in fostering goodwill. Example Subject: Friendly Reminder: Upcoming Team Meeting Dear [Recipient’s Name], I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to gently remind you about our upcoming team meeting scheduled for [date and time]. Your presence and input are highly valued, so we look forward to you joining us. 2. Provide Context Clearly state the purpose of your email and provide relevant context to jog the recipient’s memory. Be concise yet comprehensive, ensuring that the recipient understands why the reminder is necessary and what action is expected from them. Example As our project deadline is approaching, it’s crucial that we finalize the presentation slides by [deadline date]. Your expertise in [specific area] will be invaluable in ensuring the success of this project. Please review the attached draft and provide your feedback at your earliest convenience. 3. Be Specific Specify the task or event that requires attention, including any pertinent details such as deadlines, locations, or action items. Avoid vague language that could lead to confusion or misunderstanding. Example Please submit the quarterly sales report by [deadline date]. This report is essential for our planning and decision-making processes. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you require any assistance or additional information. 4. Include a Call to Action Clearly outline the steps the recipient needs to take and any deadlines associated with those actions. A call to action provides clarity and encourages prompt response or action. Example To confirm your attendance, please RSVP by clicking on the following link: [RSVP link]. If you cannot attend, kindly let us know so we can make the necessary arrangements. If you are concerned your call to action may not be strong enough or elicit a timely response, you can always use the SaneReminders feature from SaneBox to help you follow up later on. Think of it like a timer: you specify the information with an @sanebox.com email in the To or CC line, and SaneBox takes care of the rest. 5. Express Appreciation Express gratitude for the recipient’s cooperation and assistance. Acknowledging their efforts reinforces positive behavior and encourages continued collaboration. Example Thank you for your attention to this matter and for your continued dedication to our team’s success. Your contributions are truly valued and appreciated. 6. Use a Polite Closing End your email with a polite closing that leaves a positive impression. A courteous farewell demonstrates professionalism and respect for the recipient’s time. Example Once again, thank you for your cooperation. We look forward to your prompt response. Please don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Dimspire.me on Product Hunt Feb 29, 2024 [Tweet] On a whim I’ve put the new Dimspire.me site up on Product Hunt. I’ve been putting a lot of love into it and even if I were to stop now, I think it’s a great collection of nihilist inspirations (and wallpapers), enough to last quite a while. I’d love it if you’d take a second and leave a review. Thanks! Black Ink giveaway! Feb 26, 2024 [Tweet : Mastodon] I’m excited to offer the next giveaway, a license ($29.95 value) for Black Ink.

It can load any puzzle file designed for the Across Lite puzzle format, and offers a beautiful way to solve them on your Mac, with the option to print them out and solve them old-school with a pen(cil).

Dimspirations in your feed Feb 24, 2024 [Tweet : Mastodon] I’ve added (well, fixed) the RSS feed for Dimspire.me. You can now subscribe via your favorite feed reader at Dimspirations RSS (or just enter https://dimspire.me in your subscribe field, the feeds are discoverable). The feed is available in XML and JSON flavors, and each entry just contains a pithy description and one image. You can also sign up to receive Dimspirations in your email, max one email per day, and only when there’s new stuff: Enter your e-mail address: Dimspire Me Thanks for supporting this little project. I’ve decided if I ever monetize it, it will be through merch (posters, calendars, coffee mugs, etc.). So the wallpapers and dismal inspirations will continue to be free online. P.S. I’ve received some flack for occasionally going “political” with the Dimspirations. I don’t think things like being disgusted by a lack of gun control, being anti-genocide, or laughing at manufactured outrage are extreme political views, but I promise to keep those to a minimum. Sometimes I get a little fired up — don’t let it scare you away. The TaskPaper giveaway winners! Feb 23, 2024 [Tweet] The TaskPaper giveaway has ended, and I have winners to announce!

Dimspire.me Feb 22, 2024 [Tweet : Mastodon] I couldn’t sleep last night. I’m not manic, I’m just going through this months-long bout of insomnia. At least I don’t think I’m manic. It doesn’t have any of the characteristics of my usual mania. And up until last night I wasn’t even getting out of bed when I couldn’t sleep. But last night I did, and I made you a website. Introducing Dimspire.me. It’s built on Jekyll and has a bunch of automations. I can essentially create a “dimspiration” using an Affinity Photo template, and then RetroBatch will output wallpaper sizes (including iPhone) and square versions for posting and populating the gallery. Just running rake will find new photos added to the assets folder and generate posts for them, which will then populate the index pages. It should be pretty simple to maintain. All documented in a Howzit notes file, of course. The site is pretty simple: a homepage with description and the latest few posts, a “Dimspirations” page that’s essentially a blog post index but done in gallery fashion, and a random dimspiration page that will just throw single random dimspirations at you. Fun stuff. When viewing a single Dimspiration (by clicking on any thumbnail), you get some cool UI showing edges of the previous and next Dimspiration. I like it, anyway. There’s still some work to do on certain breakpoints, but overall the styling should work on any device. And every Dimspiration page has a download button, where you can download all available versions of the current Dimspiration. This is accomplished by a Rake task that parses every post, extracts the YAML key that defines the image for the page, then zips up every file in the assets directory that matches it. It creates a manifest table that shows what’s in the zip file, with each individual file linked. So when there are wallpaper versions of a Dimspiration, you can download the set or follow a link to a specific version. Took a little thinking and tweaking, but I think it’s a good solution. I hope you enjoy it. It’s cathartic for me to create these, and they’re getting better with time. I’m not going to try to monetize any of this at this point, but I’ve watermarked all the images so if you share them, they should trace back to me. Speaking of, I do still need to consider adding share buttons to these… but it always freaks me out how much data social sites collect when you include their button, so I’ll need to figure out ways around that. We’ll call that “next step.” Love always, Brett Brett Terpstra Brett is a writer and developer living in Minnesota, USA. You can follow him as ttscoff on Twitter, GitHub, and Mastodon.
