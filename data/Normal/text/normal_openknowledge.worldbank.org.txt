The report consolidates information on gender gaps and drivers of inequality in human endowments, economic opportunities, ownership and control of assets, and voice and agency. This includes identifying factors that deepen inequalities, and effectiveness of current policies and programming in narrowing gender disparities. The aim is to also identify promising and good practices that can potentially be replicated for greater impact, cascading to all areas in the country. The analysis guided by a conceptual framework that describes the ways households, markets, and institutions (both formal and informal), and their interactions all influence gender equality and economic development outcomes. Additionally, attention is paid to intersecting identities of women and men that affect their ability to access services and opportunities, including disability status, place of residence and other socio cultural and economic factors. The assessment draws on several data sources collected using mixed methods. Available quantitative and qualitative data sources form the basis of the assessment, including surveys, national and institutional reports and broader feminist and economic literature. Robust stakeholder consultations, including representatives from Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ), development partners, the United Nations (UN), Non- Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and communities grounded the analysis and provided insights into priority setting and forward-looking strategies.Show moreLoading...PublicationSurvey Report: Service Delivery Indicators Health Survey for Moldova (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2024-03-04) World Bank GroupShow moreThe Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) health survey in Moldova serves as a vital tool for assessing and benchmarking the performance of health service delivery. Its primary aim is to evaluate the quality of basic health services. This comprehensive evaluation enables both governments and service providers to pinpoint deficiencies and bottlenecks in health service delivery, monitor progress over time, and make cross-country comparisons. The widespread availability of and public awareness about SDI indicators foster engagement among policy makers, citizens, service providers, donors, and stakeholders, in turn driving efforts to enhance service quality and ultimately development outcomes.Show moreLoading...PublicationPublic Health Expenditure for Universal Health Coverage in Ghana (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2024-03-04) Agyekum, Enoch Oti; Ngetich, Elisha; Smith, Owen; Wang Sonne, Soazic Elise; Chen, Dorothee; Corral Rodas, Paul AndresShow moreGhana has made substantial progress toward universal health coverage (UHC) andcompares relatively well in health outcomes among its economic peers. Internationalcomparisons of government current health expenditure suggest that Ghana spends less than the sub-Saharan African norm for its income level. That notwithstanding, Ghana compares favorably with its peers in key health outcomes with a mixed pattern of equity in health service utilization. The trajectory indicates that better health outcomes could be achieved if health spending increases. Public funding through the Ministry of Health’s (MoH’s) budget and the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) constitute the major sources of financing for the health sector in Ghana.. Total government health spending in Ghana almost tripled in nominal terms in 2015-20, but it rose by a modest 12 percent in real terms, and nearly all the increased spending was channeled through MoH instead of through NHIA. On average, 80 percent of the government budget is channeled through the MoH budget, while the share of NHIS spending has declined over the same period from 24 percent to 12 percent. There are preliminary signs that past achievements in financial protection largely attributable to the impact of the NHIS are being eroded. Although the social contract underpinning the establishment of the National Health Insurance Levy is not in question, the recently introduced Statutory Funds Capping Law further threatens the sustainability of the NHIS. There is a need to improve efficiency in the functional allocation of domestic health resources and upscale the use of public financial management (PFM) tools at the national and subnational levels to enhance budget credibility and expenditure tracking. To ensure no one is left behind, deliberate efforts should be made to improve equity in health care utilization and outcomes along income and regional dimensions.Show moreLoading...PublicationLearning Can’t Wait: Lessons for Latin America and the Caribbean from PISA 2022 (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2024-03-04) Arias Ortiz, Elena; Bos, Maria Soledad; Chen Peraza, Juliana; Giambruno, Cecilia; Levin, Victoria; Oubiña, Victoria; Pineda, Jasmine Anne; Zoido, PabloShow moreThis report explores the results of the latest round of PISA for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), showcasing the results for the region, the differences within the region and between the region and the rest of the world. For this round of PISA, 14 countries of LAC participated in the assessment, representing the largest number of LAC countries in the assessment since its inception. The report covers three key insights: (1) learning is low and highly unequal in LAC, (2) for most countries trends in learning are not moving in the right direction; and (3) countries in LAC should ensure that all students acquire at least basic proficiency in foundational skills, by addressing disparities and focusing on the effective use of technology.Show moreLoading...PublicationFY 2023 Uzbekistan Country Opinion Survey (Washington DC: World Bank, 2024-03-04) World Bank GroupShow moreThe Country Opinion Survey in Uzbekistan assists the World Bank Group (WBG) in better understanding how stakeholders in Uzbekistan perceive the WBG.
