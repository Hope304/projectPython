Geocities Archive Geocities Mirror / The 90s Archive (1990s 2000s nineties) / The Early web O O c i t i e s . o r g A living memorial on early Web culture and an effort to maintain an amazingly extensive collection of information Recently visited pages: Recently Welcome to OoCities.org In October 2009 we archived our olden cities of the web: The unique pages on "GeoCities.com" just before they were taken down. Geocities started in 1994 and was the first giant "social network" and one of the most important websites in the world until it was closed on 27.10.2009. Our aim is to save those pages which are worthy and unique scientific sources or are of great public interest as well as those, which are historically interesting or just representing the 90's website culture and style. If you are interested in these old pages feel free to browse around. Please note: it will be a while until all pages are sorted, complete and free of any spam contents! In case you are searching for your own personal site, there is a small chance that we have it but have not put it online yet. In case you want your own page, email or picture to be removed, contact us as well. For any questions, read our FAQ or contact us at oocities {AT} gmail {DOT} com Search If you remember an old geocities username exactly, then you can just try to go to the website "**.oocities.com/**username" without searching or looking through the lists. (The google search above includes results from oocities.com/org, geocities.ws, reocities.com, internetarchaeology.org, webcitation.org, deletedcity.net. Google is not aware of everything avaiable but major parts except for web.archive.org which is not in google.) Team members wanted There's still just a small group of people working on OoCities, but there is a lot of work to get done. Please contact us if you're interested in helping out, especially on one of the following tasks: * Categorizing random pages written in your native language and deleting malicious content. * Translating our main page into your native language. * Answering email requests to find or remove certain pages. * Coding server-side scripts. GeoCities Neighborhoods Until 1999, GeoCities pages were sorted into categories using the following scheme: GeoCities.com/neighborhood/number starting with number 1000 and counting up to 9999. Thus each neighborhood (=category) or subneighborhood contains up to 9000 pages.
