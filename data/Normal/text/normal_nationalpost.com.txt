Meanwhile, as energy researcher and commentator Parker Gallant tells Brian Lilley this week, we’re throwing billions at battery plants that lack materials and even markets, as buyers shun EVs and push demand for power infrastructure we don’t have. As Gallant explains, all these “net-zero” plans being forced on us by Ottawa look like they could well be ruinously costly — while driving us in the wrong direction.
