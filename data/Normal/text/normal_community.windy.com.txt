Announcements Announcements regarding Windy System Status 238 Topics 4847 Posts T Hi, thanks for the Nowcasting feature. Now I got 3 apps that can predict the rain in The Netherlands. (The other 2 are https://buienradar.nl/ and https://www.buienalarm.nl/) There is 1 thing I find a but annoying about Nowcasting. If I press the play button on the rain radar it runs the "last hour" animation, but after that it stops. What I would like to see is that the animation directly progresses into the forecast once the "real" data has been shown. Could you add this?

Works properly at mag level 8,9,10, but disappears at level 11. Same problem with Firefox or Chromium browser, desktop version. Also works properly at level 12,13 after auto- switching to topo base map, but not at level 11 with default base map.
