You can follow and talk with anyone else that has an account on any other fediverse service, and you can even host your own server if you want.It implements the ActivityPub protocol, a standard format for sharing data between servers. This allows us to send text and media to any other service implementing ActivityPub.For those more familiar with the fediverse, Akkoma is a specialised fork of Pleroma. It is faster-paced in development and aligns itself more closely with Misskey than Pleroma mainline.It differentiates itself with a focus on custom expression, for example with custom emoji reactions, or Misskey-Flavoured Markdown.In short: Akkoma is part of a distributed social network. Sorta like the child of twitter and email.What can I do with Akkoma?Post statuses, with photosWith unlimited attachments per post, you can share photos, videos, and more.Follow people anywhere on the fediverseKeep up with your friends and collect them into lists to customise what posts you see!React to your friends’ postsHave something to say, but not something you can put into words?

It forms a network with all other instances, to create a social networkWhat is the fediverse?The fediverse is a network of independent servers running different social media software, all communicating through the ActivityPub protocol. It is a decentralized network, where each server is independent and can be run by anyone.Why do I have to choose an instance?For the same reason you need to choose an email provider (like gmail). You need a way to send activitypub data, and an instance lets you do that.Why did you fork from Pleroma?Long story. Boils down to not having faith that pleroma dev will ever recover. A longer-form explanation is available at https://coffee-and-dreams.uk/development/2022/06/24/akkoma.htmlWhy did you remove chats?Chats were incredibly poorly implemented in pleroma, and added far more complexity to the codebase than they were worth. It is my view that real-time chats do not fall into the scope of an activitypub implementation, and should be handled by a separate service. I have no plans to add them back in.Is it possible to migrate to Akkoma from Pleroma?Yes, entirely! Check the documentation for more info.Is it possible to migrate from Akkoma back to Pleroma?Yes, although it's not as easy. You'd have to roll back migrations, but all akkoma changes are 100% reversible and non-destructive.AkkomaMagically expressive social mediaFeaturesFAQDocumentationSource code© Copyright 2023.
