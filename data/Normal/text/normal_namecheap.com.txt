Why is domain name registration required? When you build a website, you want visitors to come and see what you've done. To get them there, you need a unique domain name that connects to your site's servers. Domain name registration is required to ensure that no one else in the world can claim ownership of your site's address and to make finding your website simple. Find your one of a kind domain name. How does domain registration work? Think of the name you want to register. The answer is typically your company or website name. It is best to keep your domain name short and easy to understand. Say it out loud, and make sure it sounds great. Next, search to see if it is available. If the name you desire is taken with the .com top-level domain, there are hundreds of others available. Finally, add the top choices to your cart and complete the domain registration. What domains are available from Namecheap? At Namecheap, you can register brand new domain names using hundreds of popular TLDs.

If you have a website domain for sale, Market is the place for you. Our dedicated platform offers in-house auctions and Buy It Now listings, visited by thousands of people every day. List your domains at a fixed price and we’ll take care of the rest. What’s the best way to find a cheap domain? It’s all about knowing where to look. We’ve gathered together our most popular deals on one page so you can easily find your perfect domain name, hosting, and more at affordable prices. Just take a look. How do I choose the right domain registrar? While price is a big factor, there are also other areas to consider when choosing the right domain registrar. These include customer support, security, and effortless account management. All of which come as standard with Namecheap — alongside a great price, of course. How do I pick the right domain name?
