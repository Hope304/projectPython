Download Case Study Technology Linked Data Knowledge Graph Extracted entities are linked with the huge amount of additional data available in our internal Knowledge Graph, which contains both open and proprietary high-quality data. This Knowledge Graph is in turn linked to the Linked Open Data Cloud.
