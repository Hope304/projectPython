Read more Migration can be an effective poverty reduction tool for migrants and their families and can make significant contributions to development efforts in both countries of origin and destination Food insecurity can be a driver of migration for individuals and their families. Addressing the health and well-being of migrants is a precondition for social and economic development. Education can facilitate migrant children’s socio-economic integration and improve their livelihoods as adults. Water scarcity and related issues may impact on living standards, food availability and health which in turn can be drivers of migration. Inexpensive and alternative energy solutions can benefit vulnerable or displaced communities with limited or no access to electricity. Decent jobs and safe and secure work environments for migrants are essential if they are to become productive members of society and contribute to economic growth. Migration can be a source of empowerment for women and girls, but they can also be especially vulnerable to violence, sexual abuse and exploitation. Migrants can transfer valuable knowledge and skills to their countries of origin and destination, helping to support technology development, research and innovation. Effective migration governance is vital for safer, more orderly and regular migration, which is a crucial factor to achieve sustainable development. Migrants help cities to thrive and become more vibrant, successful centres of economy and life. Promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns can help to protect migrant workers from exploitation. Migration can be a potential climate change adaptation strategy and a way to build resilience. Combatting marine and coastal ecosystem degradation and diversifying the livelihoods of communities that are dependent on marine resources can help address forced displacement and migration. Deforestation, land degradation, desertification and biodiversity loss can have profound impacts on communities whose livelihoods rely on natural resources and can be drivers of migration. Stronger, more transparent and accountable institutions and improved access to justice can help to protect and promote migrants’ rights. Timely, reliable and comparable data on migration can help policy makers devise evidence-based policies and plans to address the migration aspects of the SDGs.
