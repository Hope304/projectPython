Ka-Ping Yee Ka-Ping Yee zestypinggmailcom After finishing graduate school at UC Berkeley, I joined Google.org as a software engineer. In 2015, I left Google and joined Wave. Hooray! Here's my CV. here Interested in voting? See the voting page for work on electoral systems, electronic voting, and voting system security. Or check out my dissertation on electronic voting. Like to play with the Web? Try Regender or the Malkovich Mediator for a new perspective. Do you use Python? Try q.py, a module that helps you see what's going on in your programs; here's a quick 5-minute intro. Or check out scrape.py, a handy module for scraping content from webpages. Want to learn Python? Have a look at the online lab exercises and assignments for the Python course I taught at UC Berkeley. Here's a list of some things I've done. I'm still figuring out how to organize it.
