Ephemeral New York | Chronicling an ever-changing city through faded and forgotten artifacts Ephemeral New York Chronicling an ever-changing city through faded and forgotten artifacts An 1895 photo shows one of the last “squatter shacks” on Riverside Drive March 4, 2024 Wen Riverside Drive opened in 1880, the expectation was that this winding avenue opposite the new Riverside Park would attract well-off folks looking for a choice spot to build a stand-alone mansion or Beaux-Arts row house with riverfront views. But as upper-class families began moving to what was then known as Riverside Avenue, poor New Yorkers and their flimsy shanties were right down the block. These New Yorkers came to the area around the Drive before an avenue officially opened—when the smoke from the Hudson River railroad, lack of public transportation, and sparse population of the area kept well-to-do New Yorkers away and attracted some who lived on the margins. The photo, from 1895, shows one of these shacks on Riverside Drive and 80th Street. Looking north, fine houses and are in view—a stark contrast to this hard-luck shelter. The caption notes that the photo is “showing the transitional aspects” of the Drive, calling the shack in the foreground “one of the last” on the street. Maybe the caption is referring to 80th Street, because it’s likely not the last squatter shack on Riverside. Others still existed at about the same time above 96th Street, like these in this previous post. In the early years of the 20th century, with new apartment houses joining the mansions and row houses on the drive, the shacks vanished. Where the occupants went is a mystery. Curious about the backstory of Riverside Drive? Join Ephemeral New York on a fun and insightful walking tour of the Drive.

But instead of joining the ranks of educators, Schimmel became part of the vast brigade of the city’s peddlers and vendors. He then opened a knish shop on East Houston with his cousin, states Sam Roberts in a 2010 New York Times article. The knishery relocated to its current site in 1910. Schimmel left the knish business early on, wrote Roberts. He likely missed what was dubbed in 1916 the “knish war,” which involved a knish baker on nearby Rivington Street slashing his knish price from five to three cents, among other tactics, to undercut a rival knishery across the street. Who knew the knish business was so cutthroat? Now there are no rival knish bakeries; Yonah Schimmel’s is the only one left on the Lower East Side. (Yonah Schimmel has even outlasted Mrs. Stahl’s knishes in Brighton Beach, which closed in 2005.) Schimmel’s namesake knishery continues to turn out doughy pillows of potato and kasha that go from the oven to an ancient display case. The store signage remains charmingly frozen in time. Images of the shop reveal how little has changed, despite the transformation of so much of East Houston Street—once a Jewish immigrant main drag that became a trendy nightlife destination in the 1990s and early 2000s. In the second photo, from about 1940, there’s a vertical knish sign—how wonderful if it managed to survive and is in storage somewhere! But otherwise, the little shop’s windows and doorway, save for a ramp, appear the same. Thirty-three years later, Hedy Pagremanski painted a robust view of Yonah Schimmel’s (third image) looking eerily as it does today. Pagremanski depicts the current signage above the store (with it’s curious misspelling of Schimmel), a crowd of neighborhood folks, and signs of life in some of the tenement windows, like flower boxes and curtains. Instead of another tenement on the right, there’s just an empty lot—hardly an uncommon sight on the Lower East Side of the 1970s. The last image shows the current Yonah Schimmel’s. Flanked by a featureless hotel on the right and a reflective glass box on the left (RIP Sunshine Cinema), the knishery comes off as a relic of a very different Manhattan. Which it is—and the city is better for it.

But when a contemporary sign happens to be stuck underneath original signage made with decorative tile and an unusual typeface—as it is inside the Sixth Avenue F and M station at 14th Street—the old-school sign wins hands-down. Subway.org states that this station opened in 1940. Uptown, the Bronx, Queens…and a slender arrow below them to point the way.

A century later, his descendants comprised one of the richest families in Gotham. The Rhinelanders made their money as shipbuilders, sugar importers, and stewards of a vast real estate empire across Manhattan, states the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts. The Rhinelander Sugar House once on William Street, Rhinelander Row and Rhinelander Gardens in Greenwich Village, the Hardenburgh-Rhinelander Historic District on East 89th Street—all are named for 18th and 19th century family members from this old-money clan. But there’s another landmark in Manhattan that still bears the Rhinelander name: the Rhinelander Industrial School at 350 East 88th Street. These days, the school is a ghostly shell between First and Second Avenues, its stepped gables and terra cotta “R” on the front facade (below) behind construction scaffolding. But within its brick walls (now sadly covered in stucco) holds the story of two Rhinelander family heiresses and the gift they gave to needy children in what was then a poor immigrant neighborhood. The sisters, Julia and Serena Rhinelander (in the above illustration), were born into a wealthy household at 477 Broadway in 1824 and 1829. In 1840, their father, William C. Rhinelander, moved the family to two adjoining houses that formed one mansion at Fifth Avenue and Washington Square North—at the time a fashionable enclave for Manhattan’s most elite. In time, Julia and Serena’s sister and brother left the family mansion; their parents passed on. But the sisters, who never married, continued to live in the house at 14 Washington Square. As heirs to a reported $50 million fortune, they didn’t have to work. Instead, they traveled, they attended social events, and they devoted themselves to philanthropy. One of the philanthropic measures they decided to take on was the funding of a school that would be owned and operated by the Children’s Aid Society. The Society, launched in 1853 by Reverend Charles Loring Brace, began opening schools across New York City in the 1880s and 1890s where poor children could take regular classes while also learning a trade. Wealthy New Yorkers donated the funds to build these schools. Julia and Serena decided they would as well, and they also donated a plot of Rhinelander family land on East 88th Street where the school would be located. Unfortunately, Julia Rhinelander never lived to see the school completed; she died in 1890 while vacationing in France. Serena, now alone in the family mansion (below, the house on the corner), did see the Rhinelander Industrial School open in May 1891. Designed by Calvert Vaux (the architect behind many of the Society’s schools and homes for kids), the facility was described as a “beautiful building” by the New York Times, who noted that it had space for about 300 children, including a “kindergarten, sewing, and cooking schools.” The school thrived as Yorkville’s population boomed. “By 1902, the Rhinelander Industrial School was serving 477 children, only up through age 12 because ”the children go to work at the age of 13,” according to the annual report of that year,” wrote Christopher Gray in the New York Times in 1989. “Boys were taught manual trades and girls were taught cooking to provide household economy to those who needed it most,” added Gray. Serena Rhinelander died in 1914 in her mansion at 14 Washington Square, after a lifetime of donating liberally to churches and charities in her “quiet and unostentatious way” according to her obituary in the New-York Tribune. Meanwhile, the school changed with the times throughout the 20th century. The building was remodeled in the 1950s, noted Gray, gaining its stucco facade. It’s unclear how long classes were held and what subjects were taught. Yorkville by the late 20th century was no longer an immigrant neighborhood, and industrial schools that taught sewing and cooking had outlived their usefulness. In 1989, the school was renamed the Rhinelander Children’s Center. As of 2014, the Children’s Aid Society was trying to sell the building to raise money for a new facility in the Bronx. Considering that the former industrial school is behind scaffolding, it appears to have been sold. What does the next chapter hold for this relic of Gilded Age benevolence? Perhaps the school is undergoing redevelopment—or waiting for the wrecking ball.

[“Winter, Fifth Avenue,” 1893] At the turn of the 20th century, Stieglitz helped make photography a respected art form, staging a successful show at Gramercy Park’s National Arts Club in 1902. He experimented with different photo technology and processes, and he furthered the careers of early photographers like Edward Steichen. Steichen, along with Stieglitz, was a founding member of the Photo-Secession movement, which took a “’painterly’ approach to photographic image-making,” according to Artspace. [“The Terminal,” 1893] But the achievement I’m most impressed with is as an early Gotham street photographer. Born in Hoboken in 1864 to German Jewish immigrant parents, he found his way to New York City in 1890 after studying the new medium of photography in 1880s Germany. During the next decade, Stieglitz “made New York City his central subject,” per the National Gallery of Art (NGA). “He walked the streets with a handheld camera, which allowed for more spontaneity than a large camera mounted on a tripod. He concentrated, as he had in Europe, mainly on working-class scenes of daily life, albeit now conveyed with a greater immediacy,” continued the NGA. [“The Flatiron,” 1903] To achieve the pictorial quality he strived for, he made a point of photographing city scenes in snow and rain—which lent an Impressionist effect to his images and bathed gritty streets in a glowy or misty softness, explains the Art Institute of Chicago. “Stieglitz soon realized that technical challenges other photographers largely shied away from, such as rain, snow, and low light, could be a boon to his picture-making,” states the NGA. “Although such conditions were difficult to work in, they helped unify compositions, softened the unruly city, and tied it to nature.” [“Winter, New York,” 1898] But harsh weather conditions didn’t obscure the austerity of New York’s streets. Viewing “Winter, Fifth Avenue” showcases the raw, difficult conditions the carriage driver is facing as he struggles his way up the avenue. Conditions were raw for Stieglitz as well, who wrote in 1897 that capturing this image of the carriage driver required that he stand for three hours with his “hand camera” awaiting “the proper moment” to shoot. “An Icy Night in New York,” from 1898 (below), appears to be a benign nocturnal park scene. But the trees flanking the sidewalk can be interpreted as symbols of a menacing and mysterious city. Throughout his life, Stieglitz continued to photograph New York City, with an increasing focus on the older New York of his young adult years subsumed into the modern skyscraper city. He captured the Flatiron building, ringed by snow-topped trees, in 1903. Like most New Yorkers, the completion of this 20-plus story structure on 23rd Street made a big impression on him. “I suddenly saw the Flat-Iron Building as I had never seen it before,” he said, per the Art Institute of Chicago. “It looked, from where I stood, as if it were moving toward me like the bow of a monster ocean steamer, a picture of the new America which was in the making.” [Self-portrait, 1886] The city was changing, and Stieglitz was determined to capture the shift. “My New York is the New York of transition—The Old gradually passing into the New. . . . The Spirit of that something that endears New York to one who really loves it—not for its outer attractions—but for its deepest worth—& significance. —The universal thing in it,” he wrote in 1920, via the Art Institute of Chicago. By this time, Stieglitz had earned a name for himself as one of the most accomplished photographers of the impending Modernist age. [“From ‘Room 3003’ – The Shelton, New York, Looking Northeast, 1927] As Modernism dawned in the early 1900s, Stieglitz would switch his style to “a more straightforward depiction of quotidian life,” states the Metropolitan Museum of Art, illustrated by this East Side snow-topped tenement panorama above.

February 25, 2024 I’m thrilled to announce that Ephemeral New York’s walking tour of Gilded Age Riverside Drive is on the calendar in March and April 2024 and ready for signups: Tour Dates and Times: Sunday, March 24, 1-3:30 p.m.Sunday, April 14, 1-3:30 p.m. “The Gilded Age Mansions and Memorials of Riverside Drive,” in conjunction with Bowery Boys Tours, starts at 83rd Street and ends at 108th Street. In between, we’ll stroll the gentle curves of Riverside Drive opposite Riverside Park at a breezy pace and explore the history of this beautiful avenue born in the Gilded Age. The land that became Riverside Drive was once home to small farms and wealthy estates. After Riverside Park opened and residential development of the city’s “West End” began, the Drive became a second mansion row and rivaled Fifth Avenue as the city’s “millionaire colony.” The tour will explore the mansions and monuments that still survive, as well as the incredible houses lost to the wrecking ball. We’ll also take a look at at the people who made Riverside Drive their home—from wealthy industrialists and rich business barons to actresses, artists, and writers. Sign-up information can be found here. I hope to see a great turnout on a tour that is always a fun, insightful adventure!

That’s because of the cast iron hoods that cover the stairwell as you descend underground. Decorated in a leaf pattern, the curved hoods date back to the station’s 1905 opening. The hoods mesh well with the elegant lamp posts and green bulbs on top. I’ve never seen anything like it at any other station, but this National Register of Historic Places document tells me the Borough Hall stop in Brooklyn also has a cast-iron hood. The wayback machine continues once you get to the platform. On the southbound side, there’s an original wood ticket booth—empty and dark, but quite stunning. The elegant lights, curlycue ironwork, and the slight curve of the booth give it a very Art Nouveau kind of feel. The photo is an old one from 2010—a subway ride no longer costs $2.25. (Think of it as part of the time traveling effect). Is the vintage wood ticket chopper still beside the turnstiles? I forgot to look for it, but I hope it’s still part of the station architecture. What’s the purpose of the ticket chopper? Before subway tokens were introduced in 1953, riders paid the fare via coins. The worker in the subway booth would hand them a paper ticket, and the rider gave the ticket to another employee at the chopper box, which would shred the ticket, according to the New York Transit Museum. The Wall Street station also features decorative tile work and other artistic embellishments. Riding the subway these days can be a little dicey, but if you find yourself waiting for the 4 or 5 train here, think of your time underground as a chance to step into a time machine to the subway of the early 1900s.

Rubbing elbows at the bar and bantering across tables while washing down liverwurst sandwiches are the young and old, students, business people, bridge and tunnelers, first responders, poets, and politicians. Now, time travel to the McSorley’s of the late 1930s, when it was an Irish tavern in its eighth decade serving a Bowery-adjacent neighborhood not yet rebranded as the East Village. Mugs of ale are on the tables; plates collect in a corner of the bar. Suits and ties, overcoats, and fedoras comprise the uniform of the men standing and sitting around. My guides for this trip back to Depression-era McSorley’s are two Berenice Abbott photos from 1937 (above). They showcase the darkness and light of the interior of the saloon, with patrons under gaslights. (McSorley’s had electricity at the time, but ownership preferred old-school lighting.) What was Abbott (below, in 1921), then in her 30s and already a photographer of renown in New York City art circles, doing a this workingman’s tavern? Born in Ohio in 1898, Abbott moved to New York City in 1918 to study sculpture. After spending years living in Paris, she changed her focus to photography and returned in 1929 to a transformed New York City that startled her. “’Old New York is fast disappearing,'” Abbott observed, according to the Museum of Modern Art. “‘At almost any point on Manhattan Island, the sweep of one’s vision can take in the dramatic contrasts of the old and the new and the bold foreshadowing of the future. This dynamic quality should be caught and recorded immediately in a documentary interpretation of New York City.'” Abbott became the one to document the city’s endangered spaces, securing funding in 1935 ($140 per month) from the Federal Art Project, a New Deal program that employed and paid artists for their work. Keep in mind that Abbott embarked on her project several decades before McSorley’s (above and below, 1940) was forced by court order to admit women in 1970. Because of the no-females rule, the owner allowed Abbott to take only two photos, stated a 2004 Newsday article. Abbott went on to publish many of her photos from this time in her book Changing New York, which presented documentary-style, realist images from all across the 1930s city. Her two McSorley’s images didn’t make it into the book. But I’m still curious about the customers she photographed. Who were these men—some with their backs turned away from the camera, perhaps in protest, others smiling and posing? Joseph Mitchell offers some idea. Mitchell was The New Yorker writer who penned evocative stories about Gotham’s oddballs and eccentrics, and that included the denizens of McSorley’s. In a 1940s dispatch titled “The Old House at Home” (the original name of the tavern), he described the kind of diverse clientele that drinks there today. “It includes mechanics from the many garages in the neighborhood, salesmen from the restaurant-supply houses on Cooper Square, truck drivers from Wanamaker’s, interns [sic] from Bellevue, students from Cooper Union, clerks from the row of second-hand bookshops north of Astor Place, and men with tiny pensions who live in hotels on the Bowery but are above drinking on the street.” Yet the “backbone” of McSorley’s, according to Mitchell, “is a rapidly thinning group of crusty old men, predominantly Irish, who have been drinking there since they were youths and now have a proprietary feeling toward the place.” These men were old enough to know John McSorley, the Irish immigrant who opened the bar in 1854. “They refer to him as Old John and like to sit in rickety armchairs around the big belly stove which heats the place, gnaw on the stems of their pipes, and talk about him,” wrote Mitchell. The regulars are known as “the steadies,” wrote Mitchell, and they “shuffle in” in mid-morning. “The majority are retired laborers and small businessmen. They prefer McSorley’s to their homes.” (Below photo, from 2015) Mitchell paints a portrait of the steadies as forgotten men. “Only a few of the old men have enough interest in the present to read newspapers. These patrons sit up front, to get the light that comes through the grimy street windows. When they grow tired of reading, they stare for hours into the street. There is always something worth looking at on Seventh Street. “In summer they sit in the back room, which is as cool as a cellar. In winter they grab the chairs nearest the stove and sit in them, as motionless as barnacles, until around six, when they yawn, stretch, and start for home, insulated with ale against the dreadful loneliness of the old.” [Top two photos: Berenice Abbott/NYPL Digital Collections; third photo: MOMA; fourth photo: NYC Department of Records & Information Services; fifth photo: MCNY X2010.11.5266; sixth photo: John Rooney/AP/REX/Shutterstock via The Daily Beast] Tags: bars and taverns New York City, Berenice Abbott, East Village Bars and Taverns, McSorley's 1930s photos, McSorley's Berenice Abbott Photos, McSorley's East Village Photos 1930s Posted in art, Bars and restaurants, East Village, Poets and writers | 32 Comments » February means boot scraper weather in New York City February 12, 2024 Snow, rain, sleet—the muckier the weather, the more New Yorkers of the 19th and early 20th century probably appreciated boot scrapers. These sharp blades embedded discreetly into the iron railings of city stoops were essential for making sure a guest’s boots were wiped clean of mud, slush, horse manure, ash, and other icky debris that could stick to the soles and dirty up a fine front parlor—or bring disease-causing germs into a household. This boot scraper still exists on the front steps of a Williamsburg walkup. It’s not as fancy as other boot scrapers that still exist in New York City today, but it looks like it’ll do the job and keep the home clean!

But real estate developer Charles Paterno doesn’t come across as someone who lacked boldness. In the late 19th century, Paterno (below left) was an Italian immigrant whose father and brother ran a contracting business, according to Christopher Gray in a 1999 New York Times Streetscapes column. He graduated from medical school at Cornell University in 1899, intended to become a doctor. A tragedy changed his career plans. “His father died, leaving the family in possession of a half-finished apartment house,” noted the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in Paterno’s 1946 obituary. “To assist his brother [in completing] the structure, Mr. Paterno agreed to defer his medical practice, and his success in the building profession [made him decide] to remain in it.” Paterno and his brother would go on to build more than 140 apartment buildings, including the Colosseum and the Paterno—two luxury residences completed in 1910 with spectacular curved facades opposite each other at 116th Street and Riverside Drive. When it came time to build his own mansion, however, Paterno favored old-world fortresses over pre-war masonry and terra cotta. In 1905, roughly 70 blocks north of the Colosseum and the Paterno on Riverside Drive (and next door to New York Herald publisher James Gordon Bennett’s estate), he constructed a four-story, 35-room castle. “Built of white marble, the structure was designed using an eccentric architectural vocabulary that drew influence from both Norman castles and the Rhineland,” wrote Danielle Oteri at metmuseum.org. “Attended by elegant Italian gardens and pergolas that peered out onto the Hudson, it also featured a cellar solely devoted to growing mushrooms and a swimming pool that filtered water directly from the adjacent Hudson River,” explained Oteri. The New York Times in 1946 pointed out the castle’s stone turrets “designed in a mixture of old English and Roman style,” the white marble interior containing an organ worth $61,000, the 17 greenhouses, and a swimming pool “surrounded by bird cages.” If a rich New Yorker wanted to build a castle, Inwood in the early 1900s was the right place. Sparsely populated at the time, this northern Manhattan neighborhood was already home to some sumptuous estates—including Libby Castle (above), built in 1855 for an importer and also the one-time home of Boss Tweed. Despite the wealth and success Paterno found in the real-estate business, his castle didn’t stand very long. Sensing that Inwood was ripe to become a residential area, in 1937 he announced plans to tear it down (seen here in a newsreel video) and construct Castle Village—a complex of five co-op residences for New Yorkers of a more middle-class level of wealth. Castle Village opened in the late 1930s, but its construction didn’t obliterate all traces of the castle mansion that inspired it. “Two pillars from Paterno Castle remain near the intersection of West 181st Street and Cabrini Boulevard, as well as part of the massive retaining wall that resembles a dismembered piece of the Castel Nuovo in Naples,” wrote Oteri. This pillar (above) looks like one of the surviving two. “Part of the wall was destroyed in 2005 when it collapsed and slid onto the Henry Hudson Parkway, but a large section of Paterno’s original wall remains intact, with the restored portion recreating the tone and texture of the façade’s original grandeur,” she added. Then there’s this structure, which I didn’t get to view close-up. It certainly seems like a Paterno Castle relic, perhaps some kind of an outdoor storage space? This photo shows a front view. Some sources state that the wonderful cantilevered Pumpkin House, perched high above the Hudson River, was created from remnants of the Paterno Castle. Others refute this claim; it’s just up the street from Castle Village and was more likely built on Bennett’s former property.
