Featured project Resilient Dynamic Autoencoders for Modeling and Predicting Earthquake Threats Large earthquakes generate strong ground motions and tsunamis that may lead to a significant number of casualties and cause severe impacts on social resilience in seismically active regions including the West Coast of the United States. Early warning systems have been developed to mitigate immediate threats by detecting first-arriving ground motions near an earthquake epicenter and forecasting the intensity and timing of strong destructive ground motions. To further improve the efficacy and accuracy of these systems, deep learning methods have strong potential, but it is crucial to significantly extend the forecast horizons of existing models.
