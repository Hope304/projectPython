Varias ciudades de México ahora tienen rascacielos que superan los 500 pies de altura, incluido al menos uno que no aparece en esta lista porque su torre más alta no es tan alta como la de otra ciudad del mismo estado. Una vez finalizado en 2026, Torre Rise en Monterrey se convertirá en uno de los edificios más altos de toda América del Norte y el más alto de América Latina. En varias ciudades, Zacatecas y Colima en particular, la catedral es la estructura más alta. Ambos son ejemplos de ciudades donde la integridad del horizonte histórico no debería verse alterada por torres modernas.

Multiple cities in Mexico now have skyscrapers exceeding 500 feet in height, including at least one not shown on this list because its tallest tower is not as tall one in another city in the same state. Upon completion in 2026 Torre Rise in Monterrey will become one of the tallest buildings in all of North America and the tallest in Latin America. In several cities, Zacatecas and Colima in particular, the cathedral is the tallest structure.

This time right smack in the heart of the country in metropolitan St. Louis, Missouri. Source: health.mo.gov During World War II, uranium processing work in conjunction with the Manhattan Project (yes, that project) took place in metropolitan St. Louis. According to multiple sources, approximately 8,700 tons of radioactive waste (barium sulfate) from these processes had been taken to the 200 acre West Lake Landfill in suburban Bridgeton, Missouri and mixed with 39,000 tons of topsoil. Per the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): “Some areas of the site became radiologically contaminated in 1973 when soils mixed with uranium ore processing residues were brought to the landfill and presumably used as daily cover in the landfilling operation. An adjacent property has also been impacted, presumably by erosional migration of radiologically contaminated material from the landfill.” cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.Cleanup&id=0701039#bkground Not only was this landfill a former quarry, but it also lies within the floodplain of the Missouri River. When this information became known, there was a great deal of concern about the impacts resulting from these past actions. But this is not the end to the story. There are two other important noteworthy issues: Radioactive waste was also left alongside nearby Coldwater Creek. The Bridgeton Sanitary Landfill is adjacent to the West Lake Landfill. In 2010, it was discovered that temperatures were rising below ground at the Bridgeton Landfill due to a “smoldering event.” A report from the EPA released in 2017 indicated the smoldering event was as close as 700 feet away from the West Lake Landfill. One nightmare scenario would be if this smoldering event were to somehow reach the radioactive soils contained within the West Lake Landfill. Despite multiple steps to mitigate these dangers having been taken by both public agencies and private organizations, including the installation of an isolation barrier, area residents and environmental organizations remain concerned. In fact, just last year (2023), the extent of the radioactive waste in the West Lake Landfill was found to be greater than first thought. “The site boundaries themselves aren’t expanding, but the area that will need the radioactive protective cover is larger than previously known.”Source: missouriindependent.com Many studies, samples, reports, and meetings have been completed since this issue was first identified. Unfortunately, despite all the evidence and known risks, no timeline for formal cleanup and removal of the radiation impacted materials at the West Lake Landfill has been provided by the EPA to date. Radioactive materials have a very, very long shelf life. That means what may be sufficient precautions today, may not necessarily be adequate in 10, 20, 50, or 100 years. Furthermore, Mother Nature seldom adheres to human-made rules or timelines, especially in this age of climate change. As a result, time should be of the essence for the EPA to act and get the radioactive materials in West Lake Landfill cleaned up, removed, and remediated quickly and properly. The nearby residents and community of Bridgeton have been haunted by our nation’s World War II atomic legacy far too long. Peace!

As can be seen, they are clustered in the far western suburbs in and around Ashburn, Sterling, Manassas, and other communities close to Dulles International Airport, as well as in Culpeper to the Southwest. Generally, the area near Dulles Airport is known by the moniker of “Data Center Alley.“ FYI – To make the extent of the pinpoints more visible, they have been adjusted and may not reflect the exact location on this map. In addition, the map shows many of the most prominent data center names and their locations, but does not show all of the data centers located in Northern Virginia. Map created using mygooglemaps.com Color Codes Yellow – Amazon AWS Dark Red – Equinix Black – Digital Realty Light Gray – IBM Orange – Oracle Blue – Google Dark Gray – Coresite Purple – Cyrus One Given the proximity to the federal government and its many branches and agencies, Northern Virginia is a leader for data center development. Ashburn, in particular, is home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world. Back in 2019, it was the first location to surpass one gigawatt of data center capacity. “That particular spot on the map [Ashburn, VA] is where an estimated 70 percent of the planet’s Internet traffic flows each and every day.”Source: datacenters.com But, proximity is not the only reason that Northern Virginia has seen a boom in data centers. Other contributors include but are not limited to lower cost of of electricity, digital infrastructure, and local/state government incentives/taxes. This boom in data centers does not mean everything is rosy in Data Center Alley. Particularly bothersome to nearby residents has been noise derived from the fans used to cool the data centers and which create a humming sound. Hopefully, planning professionals across Northern Virginia will establish buffer zones, transitional zoning districts between the data centers and residential areas, as well as new regulations to better separate these competing land uses and reduce the noise impacts. Furthermore, the data center owners and operators should continuously upgrade their facilities (new and old) to include quieter cooling systems. Peace!

This lovely trail meanders 1.5 miles among the Walatowa Red Rock formations of the Pueblo located just across NM 4 from the Walatowa Visitor Center. Please note: Prior to hiking the trail you must purchase a pass at the visitor center and agree to tribal rules (such as leaving no trace behind). The reddish-orange sandstone rocks are breathtaking and are constantly changing colors and hues with the movement of the sun and shadows from nearby trees, surrounding mountains, or from passing clouds. Intermixed with the various shades of green trees, shrubs, and cacti, the whole area has a festive holiday appearance under the bright blue skies. Near the far end of the loop trail is a spur footpath that leads into a delightful red rock slot canyon. It is definitely worth the extra steps to see this geological marvel up close. One cannot help be be in awe of their natural surroundings. Entering the slot canyon Trekking the slot canyon Throughout the park, the Pueblo caretakers of the site have added benches as well as a few wood pergolas to afford hikers a place to sit and relax and/or enjoy some shade. Overall, the Red Rock Trail and slot canyon provide an excellent introduction to one of the many enchanting landscapes of New Mexico. It is well worth a visit. Peace!

If New York City and nearby Newark, New Jersey data were combined, Greater New York City would lead the way in terms of international air freight. When added together, the top two gateway cities in each category (Land, Air, and Sea) had more than 1/2 trillion dollars of international freight imports/exports combined. Map created using mygooglemaps.com – Brown trucks (Land), Dark blue ship (Sea), and Light blue airplane (Air) Probably the most surprising bit of data from these lists is how high up on the air freight chart Cleveland is located. It was also surprising not to see Memphis on the air freight list given it is Fedex’s’ primary hub. The same is true for Louisville (UPS hub) and Cincinnati (DHL and Prime hubs). Guess millions of overnight packages don’t tally up to the amount of value that bulk freight, vehicles, machinery, natural resources, and similar products do. Peace!

Posted on February 19, 2024 by problogic Maybe it’s the American mindset in me, but when I hear the term “superblock,” all I can think of are over-indulgent new developments that obliterate an entire city block for the sake of “progress”…or a poorly designed urban renewal project destined to uproot minority and/or under-privileged families for the purpose of building something quite pompous and preposterous. Sorry, but in this land of Super Bowls, Superdomes, Supersonics, Superman, Supergirl, Super Dog, superhighways, supercalifragillisticexpialidocious, and super just about everything else, the term superblock cannot help but conjure up such an image. However, upon learning the meaning of superblock as it has been employed in Barcelona and other cities elsewhere outside of the United States, one cannot help but appreciate its ideal and potential implications for American cities. Just think — closely knit walkable and bikeable compact neighborhoods unimpeded by scads of cross and cut-through traffic. Be still my heart! Examples of superblock design in Barcelona – Source: nature.com That being said, the term “superblock” may need refinement to catch on here. Perhaps “people blocks,” “village squares,” or even “la plazas” might suffice, though the term “park blocks” currently being employed in Los Angeles is an excellent option. “…priority areas [in Los Angeles] have been chosen among communities “who have the least access to public space, highest health disparities, high population densities and the desire to participate in the program.”Source: archdaily.com The most exciting part is how “superblock,” or whatever term best fits, can be applied here in the United States to change urban dynamics in a variety of positive ways. These may include, but not be limited to reduced air and noise pollution, reduced car dependency, fewer pedestrian/bicycle fatalities, improved pedestrian/cycling access, more green space, more outdoor activities and options, greater transit usage, and a more vibrant street life. Green space in Barcelona before (A) and after (B) Superblocks (Superilles) – Source: citiesforum.org One only need look at maps of many American cities, especially in the Great Lakes, Midwest, Central, and Southwest to see never-ending 640 acre miles square blocks in all directions. It wouldn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that the “superblock” concept could be used over time to adapt these sprawling grids into more “people-friendly” superblocks. Street grid map of Southeast Michigan showing potential mile square superblocks – Source: maps.semcog.org Much of the road network is already in place. One only need to add pixie dust and whalla! You have it. Job done, on to the next problem. I know. It’s not quite that easy. But, with the mile roads already built, it is only a matter of adapting the interior…and minds…and politicians to the benefits of this type of urban framework. Similar mile square grid pattern in Phoenix – Source: dgtlinfra.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Greater-Phoenix-Map-Cities-and-Communities.jpg Okay…so it may take more effort than just sprinkling pixie dust across the landscape a la Johnny Appleseed. Darn it! I had just bought three truckloads from Acme Pixie Dust Incorporated! Now what am I going to do? Source: movieweb.com So, here’s my thought. Try it in some areas and see how it works. And I don’t mean just a single square mile amid a blizzard of surrounding square miles. More like in pinpointed tactical locations that have easy access to goods, services, jobs, and transportation. Perhaps in neighborhoods located near downtown or near midtown developments. Also the core of suburban cities and towns. In other words, go for the low-hanging fruit. Thankfully, others have had the same idea. In Seattle, there an ongoing attempt to do just that in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of the city. Proposed Capitol Hill Superblock – Source: theurbanist.org But even in forward-thinking Seattle, the Capitol Hill Superblock has met with resistance. Though delayed back in 2022, the city’s 2024 budget does includes some initial funds towards the effort. On a more positive note, another Seattle neighborhood will begin establishing a superblock around Garfield High School in 2024. Even some of the indiscriminate unplanned developments in developing countries are tending to skew towards the superblock concept without even trying. Perkampungan (urban villages) in Jakarta, Indonesia have taken on such a personality. `Granted that unplanned developments rarely have political and jurisdictional oversight, but at the same time. if successful, they may help promote the concept elsewhere. Unfortunately, as with most any new planning concept, there are opponents to change. These may include, but not be limited to local merchants and busnesses, police and fire departments, politicians, street/road departments, realtors, and/or property owners who feel their land might lose value or desirable access. Hopefully, once enough success stories are established, even the most vocal naysayers may come around to see the advantages of superblocks. Let’s hope so. Peace!

A minimum floor area of 25,000 square feet was required for inclusion on the map, particularly if they are a lesser known datacenter provider. FYI – To make most of the pinpoints visible, they have been adjusted and may not reflect the exact location on this map.
