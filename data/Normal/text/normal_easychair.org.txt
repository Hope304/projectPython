I appreciated much PC-expert, that works better than the other systems I used so far as a PC member. Javier Esparza, who has a larger experience, is of the same opinion. I'll therefore propose PC-expert in other occasions that may come soon. »Philippe Darondeau«The system is great. Very intuitive, very powerful.»Kurt MehlhornVice President, Max-Planck Society«Hi Andrei, I have been using your easychair system with great pleasure, for BPM05 and now for EEE/CEC06.... And I love it. »Fabio CasatiProfessor, University of Trento«Dear Andrei, We are organising MFPS in Birmingham next year and right now we are looking into different software packages to support the work of the PC. I remember that the one used for LICS last year (which was based at Manchester) was excellent, in fact the best I ever had to deal with. So far I have not been able to find out the name or the vendor of that package. Can you give me a pointer? »Achim Jung«After using EasyChair, one dreads the thought of running a workshop or conference any other way»Úlfar ErlingssonMicrosoft Research«Terrific from beginning to end. »Pascal van HentenryckResearch group leader, NICTA«Thanks as always for the great system.

It is the system designed for its users, because the main designer is also one of its main users.»Andrei VoronkovCEO of EasyChair, Professor at the University of Manchester and at TU Wien«I just submitted a paper to ICALP and was very impressed by EasyChair, which beats hands down many commercial packages I've used in the past...»Ion MandoiuProfessor, University of Connecticut●●●●●●●●●●●●●●SERVICESConference managementRegistrationPublishingSmart CFPSmart SlideSmart ProgramABOUT USAbout UsContactCareersTestimonialsPolicy for conferencesPrivacyTerms of serviceCONFERENCESCreate conferenceLicenses and pricingFAQCONTACT USCopyright © 2002-2024 EasyChair
