Latest Sawbones: A Marital Tour of Misguided Medicine - Sawbones: IVF Our podcasts → What we do → Maximum Fun is a co-op! MaxFun was founded on the idea that artists should own their own work. Now MaxFun employees own theirs, too. We believe being a co-op will protect the values that we’ve always cared about and will further ensure our sustainability as a company, just as we maintain that an audience-supported business model is the right one for creative work. We want to keep bringing you the podcasts you love for a long, long time. We’re really excited about this, and we hope you are, too.
