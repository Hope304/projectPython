Now in TPW Magazine - March 2024 Bass Without a Boat Texas anglers can find success fishing for largemouths from the bank or a kayak. I Love To Fish, but will admit to being a novice when it comes to angling for largemouth bass. At Texas' busy bass lakes, I often watch anglers speed off in big boats to their favorite spots to go trolling near the bank or in a cove. Find a Spot to Fish Fishing is a fun, affordable way for families and friends to spend time together outdoors. Try fishing for free (without a fishing license) in state parks, or buy your fishing license to help support healthy fish populations and their habitats. Get the free Outdoor Annual.
