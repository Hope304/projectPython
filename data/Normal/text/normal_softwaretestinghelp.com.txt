In our previous tutorial, we have explained how Shift left testing in detail. Earlier, we understood the nuances of Continuous Delivery (CD) where we have production-ready software at any point via continuous feedback loops. Continuous integration (CI) is the real meat behind the CD process and is the reason that makes Continuous Delivery possible. To understand CI, let’s take the terms at face value and deduce a basic definition. The first word means “ongoing” or “frequent” and the second “merged” or “made part of”. So CI is a process where something is being “merged”-“frequently”. Logically the next question is: What is something being merged and where is it merged? Considering that the CD is just the conceptual extension of CI, the answer is sort of obvious, isn’t it? The “something” that is being merged is code and the “where” is a repository or Version control. Thus, continuous integration is a process where the code is checked into a repository very frequently. Additionally, as discussed in the previous article, tests are run immediately to catch any errors each time a code check-in happens thereby setting up the necessary feedback loop for a Continuous Delivery.
