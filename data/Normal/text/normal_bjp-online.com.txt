In this Collection you will find projects and long-form interviews with artists sharing personal stories on their traditions and those they have learned from others. There are also pieces that scrutinise the customs of photography and whether they should be challenged, subverted and reconsidered. We ask, which traditions to preserve and which to forget?

It has inspired movements, acts of compassion, empathy and change. It is a force like no other. From Karla Hiraldo Voleau’s heartbreak, to Jess T. Dugan’s delicate portraits of couples reflecting on life’s ebbs and flows, to Ana Vallejo’s addiction to love, in this collection this potent subject is explored in its myriad manifestations.
