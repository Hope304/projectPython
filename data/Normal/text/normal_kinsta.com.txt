Motto is a Montreal-based web agency that focuses on building and managing sites for all types of clients, from small startups to large enterprises. Kinsta is a fast and reliable host that resolves issues as quickly as they arise. Demand for our product and content grew to the point where our former host was cratering under the pressure; after serving one too many 5XX errors, we moved over to Kinsta, and the rest was history. Kinsta support deserves a special shoutout, as they’re available 24/7 and go above and beyond to ensure our satisfaction.

There is nothing like having time to grow your business and the peace of mind that your hosting is in good hands.
