Bret Victor, struggling Bret Victor impossible dreams, or so it seems In 2013, I started the research lab that became Dynamicland. Most of my subsequent work will be found on the new Dynamicland website once it goes public in the spring of 2024. Here is some non- and pre-Dynamicland work. More can be found on my previous website. 2018 Foreword to Hamming’s “Art of Doing Science and Engineering” 2015 What Can a Technologist Do About Climate Change? 2014 The Humane Representation of Thought & notes Seeing Spaces 2013 Media for Thinking the Unthinkable & notes Drawing Dynamic Visualizations & notes 2012 Learnable Programming Stop Drawing Dead Fish Inventing on Principle 2011 Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction Scrubbing Calculator Scientific Communication as Sequential Art Tangle Interactive Exploration of a Dynamical System Dynamic Pictures & Explorable Explanations & Kill Math 2010 Our Choice Ten Brighter Ideas Apple (2007-2010) 2007 Substroke 2005 Magic Ink 2004 Alesis Micron 2001 Crosstalk coding 1997 Juvenilia (1994-1997) Blogs & blurts. 2022 Tweets (2011-2022) 2015 The Web of Alexandria & notes 2014 Meanwhile Posters: Latour, McCloud, Gershenfeld, Naya, space, modes 2013 Links 2013 The Future of Programming & notes Engelbart eulogy 2011 A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design & notes Some thoughts on teaching How many households Visualizing weights of graph edges 2007 Links 2007 Poems & diversions. 2022 Headers (2013-2022) 2020 Architecture dominates materials 2018 Notes on resonance Improvisations 1 2 3 4 etc 2016 Fever dreams 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2015 Street art 2014 Follows you 2013 Re: a strange dream Global Game Jam keynote 2012 Alligator eggs 2010 Departure 2008 Scribbles (2002-2008) 2007 Albatross 2006 Lipograms 2001 Telephobia 2000 Electronics (1997-2000) Collections.

Previously at Apple, he designed the earliest user interface concepts for the iPad and several other new hardware platforms. His work established Apple’s internal future-interfaces prototyping group, whose inventions have shipped in billions of Apple products. His later public-domain work on next-generation programming interfaces has been viewed millions of times, and directly inspired numerous products, companies, and academic papers. His work has won the Apple Design Award twice. Computing pioneer Alan Kay has called him “one of the greatest user interface design minds in the world today”, and design legend Edward Tufte recognized him as a “design theory wizard, at the cutting edge of interface designs for programming, seeing, reasoning”. He has electrical engineering degrees from Caltech and UC Berkeley.
