My instructor was awesome and always willing to help me even outside of class times. Roshini S. With clear structure and effective instructors, I was able to stay on track and perform well on the actual exam. All my instructors were knowledgeable, compassionate, and very, very helpful. Thanks for a great program! Amy M. - Samuel’s Parent Leah was fantastic. She perfectly pinpointed which areas my son could gain as many points as possible. The practice tests, tutoring, and scheduled study worked wonderfully. Leah is fabulous at working with teens and motivating them. She is also so incredibly knowledgeable about the test itself. Michael V. - Christopher’s Parent Erin has tutored both of my sons now and has done an outstanding job. She assessed where they needed to improve, made plans, and then taught them approaches and techniques that worked based on significantly better scores. I hope Erin is still doing this when time for my two girls to take their tests. Justin A. I received lots of resources and great help from the instructors. I am still in touch with one of my instructors and he has been very helpful resource for me both in the application process and in med school.
