This year our group will pursue a research project in Floer theory with a computer science component. Publications Article by Xie He and Peter Mucha Highlighted by Nature Communications The Nature Communications article Sequential stacking link prediction algorithms for temporal networks coauthored by Xie He, Peter Mucha, and others, is featured on the journal's Editors' Highlights under “Applied physics and mathematics.” Undergraduate News The 2024 Thayer Prize Exam: Saturday, April 20 Attention first-year students! The Thayer Prize Exam, a contest organized by our department each year, will take place this year on Saturday, April 20 from 10am – 1pm in Kemeny 343. The Mathematics Department Prize fund for this exam is up to $1000, to be distributed among the exam winners. The exam consists of Mathematics Olympiad style problems, and originality and creativity are heavily weighed. You may view some recent exams for practice, along with a brief history of the prizes and the list of winners from the last 13 years. Please contact the Prize Committee Chair Professor Dimitris Giannakis by Friday April 5 if you would like to take the exam but cannot take it on Saturday April 20; the alternate date is Sunday April 21.
