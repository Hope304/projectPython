View Project Senior Digital Project Manager Sam Miller Our aim was to get all of our apps available in Apple and Google Play stores as soon as we could, as all our competitors were doing the same – it felt like a race!... The apps work for both DC Thomson and their readers and bring in significant revenue, showing that their digital strategy has been successful. View Project Head of Date & Insights Peter Lund-Sorensen We chose PageSuite to develop the upgrade to our FLIPP apps after reviewing several European companies. We valued the features and roadmap of PageSuite’s platform. View Project Editor Brian Reyes We’ve worked with PageSuite to relaunch our app and e-paper. From the outset, the relationship has been nothing but positive. The advice we received was sound, as was the response to our requirements. The product is excellent and was delivered swiftly and efficiently. The technical support once it was live was fantastic too. View Project Editor of The Golden Guide Heather Alabaster I am happy with the way the PDF looks and I am confident that the performance will be consistently good. I had thought it would be too expensive for my very small operation but currently, it’s worth it! I have had a very positive experience with PageSuite whose staff has always been courteous, well organised and focused on my enquiry. View Project General Manager Rod Kenning PageSuite offered us a multi-platform solution that supported our current subscriber base but also gave us the opportunity to break news throughout our community with its news feed capability.
