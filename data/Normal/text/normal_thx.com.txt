Unfortunately, cinemas didn’t have the existing technology setup to do so. Lucas and team designed a certification program to counter these challenges. THX was born—and made available to moviegoers with the release of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Now, over thirty-five years later, products bearing the THX brand still ensure you’re getting the truest sense of the artist’s vision—audio and video—in the cinema, at home, and on the go.
