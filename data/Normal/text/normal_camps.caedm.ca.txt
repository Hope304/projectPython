Therefore, we need to find ways to help them encounter Christ and form them in the faith of his Church so that they will know the call the Lord is addressing to each of them personally.” -Pastoral Priorities of the Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton (2011)Encounter Creation!In Hosea 2:14, we read how God wishes to lead Israel into the wilderness so that He might “speak to her heart.” Our camp is set in a beautiful lake-side location so that all who attend may have the same opportunity to live, laugh, and pray in the beauty of God’s creation. Our program is set outside and unplugged from the things that often occupy regular life, so that young people can have a retreat experience together without worrying about their screens.Encounter Community!Camp offers young people the chance to build meaningful friendships with other youth who share their faith. This reinforces what many receive from their families at home and offers support to those who may find a life of faith to be lonely. OLVC facilitates this through games, sports, outdoor activities, free time, evening campfires, and the joy of spending summer days together.Encounter Christ!Our main mission at camp is allowing our young people the chance to deepen their friendship with Jesus. We will do this by offering a week filled with faith experiences like Mass, Reconciliation, Eucharistic Adoration and prayer. These are offered alongside talks and discussions that present the lived beauty of our Catholic faith to campers.OLVC is a faith-based, overnight summer camp owned and operated by the Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton, and based in Lacombe County in central Alberta.Follow Us!FacebookInstagramWho We AreOur Lady of Victory Camp is a week-long, overnight summer camp, proudly owned and operated by the Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton.
