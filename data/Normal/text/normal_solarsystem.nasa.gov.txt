Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris – along with hundreds of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.Our solar system is the only one we know of that has a planet that supports life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we’re looking for life on other worlds.Things to Know About Our Solar SystemWho Has Walked on the Moon?Read MoreFind Your Pluto TimeRead MoreWhat Do Sunrises and Sunsets Look Like on Mars?Read More10 Things to Know About the Kuiper BeltRead MoreOur Daily Skywatching GuideA detailed guide to the night sky written by a NASA expert featuring full Moon lore, asteroid flybys, stars, galaxies, constellations, and more.Learn More10 THINGS about our solar systemMany WorldsOur solar system has a star, eight planets, five dwarf planets, and thousands of asteroids, and comets.Meet Me in the Orion ArmOur solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy. We’re in one of the galaxy’s four spiral arms.A Long Way AroundIt takes our solar system about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.Spiraling Through SpaceThere are three general kinds of galaxies: elliptical, irregular, and spiral. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy.Room to BreatheOur solar system has no atmosphere. But it has many worlds – including Earth – with many kinds of atmospheres.Many MoonsOur solar system has more than 200 moons.Ring WorldsThe four giant planets – and at least one asteroid – have rings.Getting Out ThereMore than 300 robotic spacecraft have left Earth's orbit, and 24 U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon.Life as We Know ItSo far, Earth is the only place we've found life in our solar system, but we’re looking.Going InterstellarThe Voyagers are the only spacecraft to reach interstellar space. {{ fallbackText }} Eyes on the Solar System: A real-time visualization of our solar system using planetary science data.NASA/JPL-CaltechSaying Farewell: Which Spacecraft are Leaving Our Solar System?Only two spacecraft have reached interstellar space, the space between stars. Three other spacecraft have achieved enough velocity to eventually travel beyond the boundaries of our solar system.An illustration depicting one of NASA's twin Voyager spacecraft. Both Voyagers have entered interstellar space – the space outside our Sun's heliosphere.NASA/JPL-CaltechVoyager 1 went interstellar in 2012 and Voyager 2 joined it in 2018. Both spacecraft, launched in 1977, are still in communication with Earth.NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is currently exploring an icy region beyond Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. It eventually will leave our solar system.Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 also will ultimately travel silently among the stars toward the galactic core. The spacecraft used up their power supplies decades ago.Latest NewsMore NASA NewsNews Release2 min readNASA Joins Rice University for 2024 Space Studies ProgramNews Release2 min readNASA Awards Contracts for Flight, Payload Integration Services5 min read65 Years Ago: Pioneer 4 Reaches for the MoonArticle16 min readLagniappe for March 2024Article4 min readNASA Leaders Participate in Annual Stennis Day at the CapitolImage ArticleKeep ExploringDiscover More Topics From NASAPlanetsEclipsesKuiper BeltOort CloudReturn to topThe National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.About NASA's MissionJoin UsHomeNews & EventsMultimediaNASA+MissionsHumans in SpaceEarth & ClimateThe Solar SystemThe UniverseScienceAeronauticsTechnologyLearning ResourcesAbout NASANASA en EspañolFollow NASAMore NASA Social AccountsNASA NewslettersSitemapFor MediaPrivacy PolicyFOIANo FEAR ActOffice of the IGBudget & Annual ReportsAgency Financial ReportsContact NASAAccessibilityPage Editor:SMD Content EditorsResponsible NASA Official for Science:Dana Bolles
