CommonJS Spec Wiki CommonJS From CommonJS Spec Wiki Jump to: navigation, search Welcome to CommonJS, a group with a goal of building up the JavaScript ecosystem for web servers, desktop and command line apps and in the browser. This wiki is a starting point for collecting up ideas, any draft API suggestions for the CommonJS group. Discussions occur on that mailing list and on IRC (#commonjs on freenode). Contents 1 Meta 2 Current Efforts 3 Future Efforts 3.1 Low-level APIs 3.2 High-level APIs 4 Implementations 4.1 In development 5 Tests 6 Further Reading 7 Wiki Meta Introduction FAQ Process Target Platforms Coding Standards Current Efforts This is a list of issues currently being discussed / standardized. They come from the "Low level" department, as we need to have solid basics prior to building a tower. Uniform Baseline / Globals (discussion) Modules (1.1.1) binary: Binary Data Objects (byte arrays and/or strings) (proposals, discussion, early implementations) encodings: Encodings and character sets (proposals, discussion, early implementations) io: I/O Streams (proposals, discussion) fs, fs-base: Filesystem (proposals, discussion, early implementations) system: System Interface (stdin, stdout, stderr, &c) (1.0, amendments proposed) assert, test: Unit Testing (1.0, amendment proposals pending) sockets: Socket I/O TCP/IP sockets (early proposals) event-queue: Reactor Reactor/Event Queue (early proposals) worker: Worker Worker (concurrent shared nothing process/thread) (proposal) console: console (proposal) Packages (1.0) Package Mappings (proposal) Web Server Gateway Interface (JSGI) (proposals, discussion, early implementations) Promises (proposal) Pending Business / Calls for Action / Status Report Future Efforts Low-level APIs This is the collection of APIs that we'd like to see behaving consistently across JavaScript interpreters. Language and Runtime Services Logging Relational database interface ResultSets (collections of data maybe from RDBMS, maybe from other sources) Concurrency String / ByteString I/O C unified API to our Target Platforms Subprocesses (popen) High-level APIs This is the collection of APIs that implement common functionality on top of the low-level API. HTTP client APIs Email Jabber (XMPP) Internationalization Promise Manager Command line processing Implementations Implementations Standards Proposals and standards in development In development mob is implementing SecurableModules in Ejscript http://www.ejscript.org pmuellr posted a sample loader for SecurableModules: http://wiki.github.com/pmuellr/modjewel atul varma has a SecurableModule implementation for Python/Spidermonkey: http://hg.toolness.com/pydertron/raw-file/tip/docs.html Alexandre implements several commonJS standards in Wakanda (SquirrelFish) http://www.wakandasoft.com Titanium is in the process of adding support for CommonJS. http://www.appcelerator.com Tests CommonJS tests compatible with this test framework.
