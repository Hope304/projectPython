Tinybeans user since 2016 Love this app! Perfect solution It‚Äôs the perfect way to share photos of my kids with far-away family without putting their faces on social media. We‚Äôve used it since my kids were born 3.5 years ago and we LOVE it. Easy to use, fun to interact with, and keeps a lovely digital record of my kids‚Äô lives. I‚Äôve gotten my two brothers and their families hooked on it too, and I‚Äôve recommended it to many others as well. And surprisingly, the online content (blogs, lists, and memes) are actually helpful and funny. Tinybeans user since 2020 The joy of my life Tinybeans has been the joy of my life. I‚Äôm 92 and have four great grandchildren. I have followed them from birth and laughed and cried and enjoyed seeing them grow daily. The first thing I do morning and night is check my Tiny Beans. Many thanks for this light in my life! üôè Tinybeans user The calendar visual is amazing We‚Äôve been using TinyBeans as a family for nearly 5 years. We love the app! The calendar visual is literally the best. I love being able to scroll back to a day and immediately know if it was on a weekend, a Tuesday, etc. We have other family members using Google Photos or Amazon and others, but they just don‚Äôt compare to TinyBeans. I also love the ease of use, even for grandparents, the emails are perfect for them! We seriously love this app and recommend it to all our friends with kids. Tinybeans user since 2019 It‚Äôs the BEST! Having a secure platform to share photos/videos with friends and family is priceless. It‚Äôs the kickstart to my every day, before my feet hit the ground. My daughter has not missed one day of posting, since my grandchildren were born and they are 5 1/2 and 3 1/2. I‚Äôve told many about Tinybeans. Join in‚Ä¶ it will make you smile ü§ó.
