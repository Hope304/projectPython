Such a software suite was previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates to this concept. Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client with an included web feed reader, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers and corporate users. Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox source code which powers such products as Thunderbird. Legal backing is provided by the SeaMonkey Association (SeaMonkey e.V.).

We encourage testers to get involved in discussing and reporting problems as well as further improving the product. SeaMonkey 2.53.18 Beta 1 is available in 23 languages, for Windows, macOS x64 and Linux. November 6, 2022 SeaMonkey and macOS Ventura Attention macOS users! The current SeaMonkey release crashes during startup after upgrading to macOS 13 Ventura. Until we have a fix we advise you not to upgrade your macOS installation to Ventura. No usable crash information is generated and this might take a bit longer than usual to fix. This is not a problem with Monterey 12.6.1 or any lower supported macOS version so might even be an Apple bug. The problem is tracked in Bug 1797696. The SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite SeaMonkey has inherited the successful all-in-one concept of the original Netscape Communicator and continues that product line based on the modern, cross-platform architecture provided by the Mozilla project. The Internet browser at the core of the SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite uses the same rendering engine and application platform as Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed browsing, feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find as you type and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web experience. SeaMonkey's Mail and Newsgroups client shares lots of code with Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail filtering, tags and mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple accounts, S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both private and corporate use. Additional components include an easy-to-use HTML Editor, the ChatZilla IRC chat application and web development tools like a DOM Inspector. If that's still not enough, SeaMonkey can be extended with numerous Add-Ons that provide additional functionality and customization for a complete Internet experience.
