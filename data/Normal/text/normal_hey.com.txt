Hey everyone‚Äî I‚Äôm Jason, CEO here at 37signals. Email gets a bad rap, but it shouldn‚Äôt. Email‚Äôs a treasure. It feels great to get an email from someone you care about. Or a newsletter you enjoy. Or an update from a service you like. That‚Äôs how email used to feel all the time. But things changed. You started getting stuff you didn‚Äôt want from people you didn‚Äôt know. You lost control over who could reach you. An avalanche of automated emails cluttered everything up. And Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and Apple just let it happen. Now email feels like a chore, rather than a joy. Something you fall behind on. Something you clear out, not cherish. Rather than delight in it, you deal with it. And yet, email remains a wonder. Thanks to email, people across cultures, continents, countries, cities, and communities communicate every day. It‚Äôs reliable. It‚Äôs simple. It makes it easy for two humans to share their love, and for millions of people to earn a living. So good news, the magic‚Äôs still there. It‚Äôs just obscured ‚Äî buried under a mess of bad habits and neglect. Some from people, some from machines, a lot from email software. Email deserves a dust off. A renovation. Modernized for the way we email today. With HEY, we‚Äôve done just that. It‚Äôs a redo, a rethink, a simplified, potent reintroduction of email. A fresh start, the way it should be. HEY is our love letter to email and calendars, and we‚Äôre sending it to you on the Web, Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. Jason Fried Co-founder & CEO Close HEY has a calendar now!
