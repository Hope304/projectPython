Jan. 30, 2024DeepThInk: An AI brush that empowers art therapy patientsResearchers have created a new AI-assisted digital art tool designed to help art therapy patients better express themselves while maintaining the efficacy of the process. The tool, dubbed DeepThInk, was designed by researchers at the Cheriton School of Computer Science and the Southern University of Science and Technology in collaboration with art therapists. DeepThInk grew out of the challenges the therapists faced when the COVID-19 pandemic forced them to conduct their work virtually.
