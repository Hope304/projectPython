Filebin Takedown This web service provides functionality for clients to upload and download files. There is an opportunity to abuse this to share illegal, copyrighted or malicious content, even though this is against the Terms and conditions. There is no automatic moderation of such content, but anyone familiar with the location of the files can delete them at their own will. If this bin contains files that should not be here, please delete the bin. This will immediately make the files unavailable, and is faster than sending a takedown request to the service owner.

About API documentation Privacy Terms and conditions Storage capacity reached What is this? This service has a storage capacity limit in place. When overall usage is above this limit, new file uploads will be rejected until usage is below the limit again. How to get below the limit? Usage is reduced as files uploaded earlier are deleted. Files are deleted after a period of time after being uploaded, which is an automatic and continuous process. In addition, usage is reduced whenever existing files are manually deleted which users can do at any time. What to do now? If you need to upload files and the storage capacity is reached, check back soon again. Maybe then usage is below the limit and new file uploads will be accepted. Close Advertisement information Why ads now? Ads have been introduced as an experiment to see if it can offset some of the cost of running this service without a sponsor. The annual cost is approximately â‚¬500, which is currently covered by yours truly. Why no ads before? The infrastructure and bandwidth needed to host this service was fully sponsored by a former employer for more than 11 years. This sponsorship ended in November 2023 unfortunately. Providing the service without ads was possible only because of this sponsorship. Contact Reach out at contact@filebin.net if you have questions or feedback. Close
