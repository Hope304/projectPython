We can’t make decisions arbitrarily. They care about metrics, they care that our actions are backed by data, and they care about proof. STAT is great for that.” Sean Pomory "Our Google Business Profile traffic has increased drastically over the past three years. Before we started this partnership with Moz, we were averaging about 30,000 views each month from local search. Now, it’s well over 200,000. Moz Local is the perfect solution for us.” Alex Bruner "Presenting to clients is always challenging. Moz makes our team more effective when sharing data with clients, because everything is encapsulated in one dashboard. Moz has a lot of capacities to help clean up our data and present it in ways that are meaningful for clients, but still have the technical depth." Laura Simis “We've been using Moz Pro since 2012, and it is the ONLY piece of software that makes the cut time and time again. It brings so much to the table for a smaller team that has to do a little bit of everything.” Jason Nurmi "Moz Pro gives us the data we need to justify our projects and strategies. It helps us track the ROI of our efforts and brings significant transparency to our industry."
