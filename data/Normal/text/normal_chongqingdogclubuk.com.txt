It is native to the Chongqing City and Sichuan areas of China. It is a 2000-year-old multipurpose working breed, with evidence of it dating back to the Han Dynasty. As a club, we are dedicated to promoting and protecting the health and welfare of the Chinese Chongqing breed throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland by following the CKU standard and adhering to FCI rules. Established in 2018, the main purpose of our club is to represent all the interests of the Chinese Chongqing breed and their owners, to maintain a healthy standard; and to promote ethical breeding programs within the breed. Chongqing Dog Club will offer dog owners sources of education, advice on purchasing puppies, dog health, dog training and healthy, ethical dog breeding. We will be opening our club to new members where, together, we can promote the breed as a collective! Chinese Chongqing Male ALONE, WE CAN DO SO LITTLE. TOGETHER, WE CAN DO SO MUCH.
