On this dayIn 1764 is one of the earliest-known dates for the celebration of St Piran’s Day, the feast day of Saint Piran and the national day of Cornwall. It was originally observed by the tin-miners of Cornwall and the flag of Cornwall (Saint Piran’s Flag) is linked to the 5th-century Cornish abbot; in 1815 Franz Mesmer, who pioneered “animal magnetism” (mesmerism, a forerunner of hypnotism) died aged 80. Maria Theresia von Paradis, a pianist friend of Mozart who lost her sight at an early age, was claimed to have had her condition temporarily improved after treatment by Mesmer — however, a scandal led him to flee to Paris in 1778. Louis XVI’s concerns over methods used to treat Marie Antoinette, his queen, forced Mesmer into exile; in 1949 Donald Bradman played his last innings in first-class cricket; in 1966, 124 people died when a Boeing 707 (BOAC Flight 911) crashed into Mount Fuji, shortly after take-off from Tokyo. A last-minute cancellation of tickets had been made by Albert R Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and their team on a location trip to Japan for the Bond film You Only Live Twice. Nature notesLumpsuckers are extraordinarily ugly fish. Grey, shaped like a rugby ball and covered in warty protuberances, they are relatively common around Britain’s beaches, especially along rocky parts of the coastline. On their bellies is a circular sucker made of fused ventral fins, so strong that a lumpsucker can be firmly attached to a vertical surface. This comes into play in the breeding season: after the females have laid their eggs and returned to deeper waters the males guard the egg masses for six weeks, aerating the water around them with their fins while using their sucker to attach themselves to rocks so they are not swept away. Sadly, their dedication makes male lumpsuckers easy pickings for predators like gulls and otters.
