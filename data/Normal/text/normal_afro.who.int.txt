Kinsella. Credits Emergencies All → Weekly bulletin Cholera Dengue Weekly bulletin More about Weekly bulletin → The Weekly Bulletin focuses on public health emergencies occurring in the WHO African Region. Each week, a brief description, followed by public health measures implemented and an interpretation of the situation is provided for a few selected events. A table is provided at the end of the bulletin with information on all new and ongoing public health events currently being monitored in the region, as well as recent events that have largely been controlled and thus closed. Cholera More about Cholera → Cholera is an infectious disease that causes severe watery diarrhoea, and can lead to dehydration and kill within hours if left untreated. People with low immunity – such as malnourished children or people living with HIV – are at a greater risk of death if infected. WHO Credits Dengue More about Dengue → Dengue fever is an arbovirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopiticus). It is a severe, flu-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults, but seldom causes death.
