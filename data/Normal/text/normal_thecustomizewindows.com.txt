Payment terms include all terms and conditions relating to a buyer's payment obligations under a sales contract and their methods of payment. Not only sales contracts, but also all obligations arising from which payment obligations arise contain payment provisions. This … [Read more...] What is Supplier Evaluation in BusinessIn business, supplier evaluation is a systematic assessment comparable to rating, which is intended to evaluate the performance of suppliers or service providers on the basis of previously defined characteristics. It is mainly carried out in the business-to-business and business-to-administration relationship by the supplier's customer. This is where companies or public administration assess their … [Read more...] What is Energy HarvestingEnergy harvesting is the process of extracting small amounts of electrical energy from sources such as ambient temperature, vibrations, or air currents for low-power mobile devices. The structures used for this purpose are also referred to as nanogenerators. Energy harvesting avoids the limitations of wired power or batteries in wireless technologies. Energy harvesting is important for the energy … [Read more...] Basics on Rotary EncoderA rotary encoder is a rotary encoder that usually provides digital output signals that need to be decoded at the other end of the sensor line in the evaluation device. Therefore, it is also called a rotary encoder. "Encoder" is sometimes used as a generic term for all angular position encoders. Differences in the Way Signals are Evaluated Incremental Encoders Incremental … [Read more...] What is Redundancy?In information theory, the term redundancy describes information or data that is present multiple times in an information source. A unit of information is redundant if it can be omitted without loss of information. Identifying and removing such redundancies is called deduplication. Redundant is the part of a message that does not contain any information. The redundant part of the message can be … [Read more...] What is Leadership ProcessThe management process is a part of the work process that must be repeatedly controlled by a manager within a business entity in a person- and factual manner. Economic entities with management processes include companies, the state authorities, military, governments, schools/universities and other associations of persons. Here, leadership processes take place in compliance with the management … [Read more...] Automatic Room Light Controller With Arduino and PIR SensorIn our earlier articles, we have explained What is a PIR Sensor, How it Works, and Arduino Light Sensor with LDR. In this project, we will set up an automatic light control system using Arduino. You can use Arduino UNO or any Arduino-compatible microcontroller board, such as ATtiny85. If we use only a PIR Sensor to control the light then it will become ON even during the daytime. So we need a … [Read more...] What is a PIR Sensor, How it WorksA pyroelectric infrared sensor, also known as a PIR sensor, is a semiconductor sensor used to detect temperature changes. PIR sensors are based on the eponymous pyroelectricity, a property of some piezoelectric semiconductor crystals. A change in temperature ΔT leads to a measurable change in the electrical voltage. PIR sensors, unlike other temperature sensors, do not react to a certain … [Read more...] Software Maintenance and MaintainabilityIn software engineering, the term software maintenance refers to "the modification of a software product after its delivery in order to fix bugs, improve performance or other attributes, or make adjustments to the changed environment." The task of maintenance includes all measures to maintain the functionality of the IT processes and software used. This also includes necessary professional and … [Read more...] What is Design Pattern in Software ArchitectureDesign patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems in architecture as well as in software architecture and development. They thus represent a reusable template for problem solving that can be used in a specific context. In recent years, the design pattern approach has also attracted increasing interest in the field of human-computer interaction. Types of Design … [Read more...] Arduino Light Sensor: Circuit and CodeA photoresistor, also known as a photoresistor or LDR, is a light-sensitive electrical resistor. The more light falls on the photoresistor, the smaller its resistance becomes. Compared to other light-sensitive electronic components such as photodiodes, photoresistors react very slowly. A thin layer of the photosensitive semiconductor material is applied to a ceramic substrate by sintering a … [Read more...] 123…701Next Page »Subscribe To Our Free NewsletterGet new posts by email:SubscribePlease Confirm the Subscription When Approval Email Will Arrive in Your Email Inbox as Second Step.Search this website… Popular ArticlesOur Homepage is best place to find popular articles!Here Are Some Good to Read Articles :Cloud Computing Service ModelsWhat is Cloud Computing?Cloud Computing and Social Networks in Mobile SpaceARM Processor ArchitectureWhat Camera Mode to ChooseIndispensable MySQL queries for custom fields in WordPressWindows 7 Speech Recognition Scripting Related TutorialsSocial Networks Pinterest (24.3K Followers)Twitter (5.8k Followers)Facebook (5.7k Followers)LinkedIn (3.7k Followers) YouTube (1.3k Followers) GitHub (Repository) GitHub (Gists)Looking to publish sponsored article on our website?
