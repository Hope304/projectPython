Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery Menu Open Call: Apophenia Past Shows About Us Contact The longest running institution in Los Angeles devoted solely to exhibiting art. Upcoming Programs Love, LAMAG: Art Talks on Open Call: Apophenia The Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery presents Love, LAMAG, an annual program celebrating the gallery’s dedication to contemporary art since 1945. This year Love, LAMAG is a series of art talks led by LAMAG staff on Open Call: Apophenia, a non-juried exhibition featuring youth, students, professional, and non-professional artists to present their artwork side by side. The art talks are free, insightful, and short discussions on the beloved exhibition format, themes, and participating artists. The series culminates with an extended invitation to all Open Call participants to join LAMAG staff in the gallery on March 16th to celebrate the end of the exhibition.
