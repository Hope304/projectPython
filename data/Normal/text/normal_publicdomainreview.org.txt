But there was little intentionally abstract about these images: Houghton painted entities she met in the spirit regions. Viewing her works through the prism of friendship, loss, and faith, Jennifer Higgie turns overdue attention on an artist neglected by historians, a visionary who believed that death was not the end, merely a new distance to overcome. moreArt & IllustrationsReligion, Myth & Legend21 Feb 2024The Public Domain Review is dedicated to the exploration of curious and compelling works from the history of art, literature, and ideas – focusing on works now fallen into the public domain, the vast commons of out-of-copyright material that everyone is free to enjoy, share, and build upon without restrictions.“Magnificent … A model of digital curation”The Guardian“… a gold mine of fantastic images and stories.”The New York TimesVisit Our Online ShopExplore our selection of fine art prints, all custom made to the highest standards, framed or unframed, and shipped to your door.Start ExploringLatest EssaysEugène-François Vidocq and the Birth of the Detective By Daisy SainsburyBooks7 Feb 2024Through the Cheval Glass: Reproduction in the Photographs of Clementina Hawarden By Stassa EdwardsPhotography24 Jan 2024Liberal Visions and Boring Machines: The Early History of the Channel Tunnel By Peter KeelingCulture & History10 Jan 2024Rhapsodies in Blue: Anna Atkins’ Cyanotypes By Paige HirscheyArt & IllustrationsPhotography6 Dec 2023Browse More Essays…Get Our NewsletterOur latest content, your inbox, every fortnightPrivacy Policy More InfoHPBecome a Friend of the PDRWe rely on our annual donors to keep the project alive.
