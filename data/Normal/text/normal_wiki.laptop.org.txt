Our mission is to provide educational opportunities for the world's most isolated and poorest children by giving each child a rugged, low-cost, low-power, connected laptop; and software tools and content designed for collaborative, joyful, self-empowered learning. OLPC has produced XO laptops for more than 3 million children around the world, the majority of them in Uruguay, Peru, Rwanda, Haiti, Australia, Mongolia and the United States. These laptops all run Sugar and Fedora Linux, and have customized software and content builds developed by their national deployment teams in collaboration with OLPC staff. We maintain a regular update of deployment information. + Software XO 13.2.11 2020-01-29 XS xs-0.7 2012-02-20 Quote of the Day "This is not just a matter of giving a laptop to each child, as if bestowing on them some magical charm. The magic lies within -- within each child, within each scientist, scholar, or just plain citizen in the making. This initiative is meant to bring it forth into the light of day." —Kofi Annan Current projects The Contributors program offered free XO laptops to developers and content creators who are working on projects that will benefit deployments worldwide. To apply for this program, contributors submitted a description of the work they are planning along with their contact information.
