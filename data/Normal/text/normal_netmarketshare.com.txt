Market share for mobile, browsers, operating systems and search engines | NetMarketShare Market share for mobile, browsers, operating systems and search engines | NetMarketShare Market Share Statistics for Internet Technologies Login × IMPORTANT NOTICE: After 14 years of service and being used as a primary source in tens of thousands of articles and publications, we are retiring NetMarketShare in its current form. October, 2020 is the last month of data. All billing for existing accounts has been stopped. All outstanding balances are being refunded. Why? An upcoming change in browsers (https://github.com/WICG/ua-client-hints) will break our device detection technology and will cause inaccuracies for a long period of time. In addition, we have focused on bot detection and removal as a key part of the quality control process. It is the most complex part of our codebase. As time has gone on, it has become increasingly difficult to manage this process. So, instead of accepting increasing levels of inaccuracy, we thought it would be a good time to call it a day. The Future NetMarketShare will re-emerge at some point with a focus on ecommerce trends and verifiable user data. We want to thank everyone who used NetMarketShare over the years. This journey began with reporting on the browser wars, and was one of the most fascinating and fun products anyone could hope to work on.
