Testimonials Browserling did a custom cross-browser testing solution for UK's National Health Service. Our application needs to operate in complicated sub optimal technological environments where legacy software is popular and unrealistic expectations to meet modern standards impose unsurpassable barriers to implementation. Browserling guys hopped, skipped and jumped over all those barriers in record time without blinking and has put us on the innovations map. What was considered impossible amongst an international consortium was made possible by Browserling. Dr. Alexei Director, Bloomsbury Health - NHS Healthcare Innovation Every web agency needs You.
