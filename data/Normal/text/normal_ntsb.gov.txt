We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate authority​ for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.​​​​​ ​ Upcoming Events Jun 25 2024 Event Type: Board Meeting East Palestine Board Meeting Tue 9:30 AM News 27 Feb 2024 New NTSB Leaders Bring Data-Driven Approach to Improving Safety ​​​Jen Adler heads Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications; Warren Randolph is agency’s first Chief Data Officer WASHINGTON (Feb. 27, 2024)… Continue Reading 21 Feb 2024 Maintenance and Oversight Failures Led to 2022 Pittsburgh Bridge Collapse ​WASHINGTON (Feb. 21, 2024) – Critical lapses in bridge maintenance and oversight by multiple agencies led to the collapse of the 447-foot-long Fern… Continue Reading 15 Feb 2024 NTSB Issues Report on 2022 Sinking of Alaska Fishing Vessel ​​Bilge alarms did not sound before capsizing WASHINGTON (Feb. 15, 2024) — The National Transportation Safety Board determined flooding into the… Continue Reading Go to News Page ​​​​​​ Privacy Accessibility Web Policies No FEAR Act FOIA Office of Inspector General Contact Us National Transportation Safety Board• 490 L'Enfant Plaza, SW Washington, DC 20594 USA.gov (USAGov en Español) Connect With Us: ​ ​@NTSB @NTSB_Newsroom NTSB Blog ​​​
