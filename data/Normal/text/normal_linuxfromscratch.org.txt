Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code. Currently, the Linux From Scratch organization consists of the following subprojects: LFS :: Linux From Scratch is the main book, the base from which all other projects are derived. BLFS :: Beyond Linux From Scratch helps you extend your finished LFS installation into a more customized and usable system. ALFS :: Automated Linux From Scratch provides tools for automating and managing LFS and BLFS builds. Hints :: The Hints project is a collection of documents that explain how to enhance your LFS system in ways that are not included in the LFS or BLFS books. Patches :: The Patches project serves as a central repository for all patches useful to an LFS user. LFS Editor's Guide :: A document that describes the LFS development process. Museum :: Copies of ancient LFS and BLFS versions. Â© 1998-2024 Gerard Beekmans. Website design by Jeremy Huntwork & Matthew Burgess.
