Make your donation now - Wikimedia Foundation Make your donation now Jump to navigation Jump to search Template:2011FR/Appeal-default/title/en Wikipedia is still not on the market Thank you for considering a donation to the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia and other crucial free knowledge projects. We invite you to reflect on the number of times you visited Wikipedia in the past year. If the knowledge you gained here was valuable, please join the 2% of readers who donate to the nonprofit that supports Wikipedia. It is hard to know what to trust online these days. Wikipedia is different: not perfect, but also not here to make a profit or to push a particular perspective. It is written by everyone, together, because they want to help create a free repository of high-quality information. If Wikipedia has given you useful knowledge this year, please give back. There are no small contributions: every edit counts, every donation counts. Thank you. Sorry, we're having a little trouble detecting what country you're in. Please visit Ways to Give for international payment methods.
