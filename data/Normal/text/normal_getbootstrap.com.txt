Build and extend in real-time with CSS variables Bootstrap 5 is evolving with each release to better utilize CSS variables for global theme styles, individual components, and even utilities. We provide dozens of variables for colors, font styles, and more at a :root level for use anywhere. On components and utilities, CSS variables are scoped to the relevant class and can easily be modified. Learn more about CSS variables Using CSS variables Use any of our global :root variables to write new styles. CSS variables use the var(--bs-variableName) syntax and can be inherited by children elements. .component { color: var(--bs-gray-800); background-color: var(--bs-gray-100); border: 1px solid var(--bs-gray-200); border-radius: .25rem; } .component-header { color: var(--bs-purple); } Customizing via CSS variables Override global, component, or utility class variables to customize Bootstrap just how you like. No need to redeclare each rule, just a new variable value. body { --bs-body-font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace); --bs-body-line-height: 1.4; --bs-body-bg: var(--bs-gray-100); } .table { --bs-table-color: var(--bs-gray-600); --bs-table-bg: var(--bs-gray-100); --bs-table-border-color: transparent; } Components, meet the Utility API New in Bootstrap 5, our utilities are now generated by our Utility API. We built it as a feature-packed Sass map that can be quickly and easily customized. It's never been easier to add, remove, or modify any utility classes. Make utilities responsive, add pseudo-class variants, and give them custom names. Quickly customize components Apply any of our included utility classes to our components to customize their appearance, like the navigation example below. There are hundreds of classes available—from positioning and sizing to colors and effects. Mix them with CSS variable overrides for even more control.

Import Bootstrap first, then use Sass map functions to modify, add, or remove utilities. @import "bootstrap/scss/bootstrap"; $utilities: map-merge( $utilities, ( "cursor": ( property: cursor, class: cursor, responsive: true, values: auto pointer grab, ) ) ); Explore the utility API Powerful JavaScript plugins without jQuery Add toggleable hidden elements, modals and offcanvas menus, popovers and tooltips, and so much more—all without jQuery. Bootstrap's JavaScript is HTML-first, meaning most plugins are added with data attributes in your HTML. Need more control? Include individual plugins programmatically. Learn more about Bootstrap JavaScript Data attribute API Why write more JavaScript when you can write HTML? Nearly all of Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins feature a first-class data API, allowing you to use JavaScript just by adding data attributes. Dropdown Dropdown item Dropdown item Dropdown item <div class="dropdown"> <button class="btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" type="button" data-bs-toggle="dropdown" aria-expanded="false"> Dropdown </button> <ul class="dropdown-menu"> <li><button class="dropdown-item" type="button">Dropdown item</button></li> <li><button class="dropdown-item" type="button">Dropdown item</button></li> <li><button class="dropdown-item" type="button">Dropdown item</button></li> </ul> </div> Learn more about our JavaScript as modules and using the programmatic API.
