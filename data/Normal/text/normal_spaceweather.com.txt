NASA's MERRA-2 climate model predicts when the air up there is cold enough: On Mar. 05, 2024, the Arctic stratosphere is too warm for Type II polar stratospheric clouds. | more data. Noctilucent Clouds The southern season for NLCs is over. The first clouds were detected inside the Antarctic Circle on Dec. 4, 2023, by the NOAA 21 satellite. The same satellite detected the last cloud on Feb. 21, 2024. Daily maps are now blank: Updated: Feb 22, 2024 An instrument onboard NOAA 21 (OMPS LP) is able to detect NLCs (also known as "polar mesospheric clouds" or PMCs). Now that the southern season has ended, attention turns to the northern hemisphere. The first NLCs should appear inside the Arctic Circle in mid to late May.

MARCH IS THE BEST MONTH OF THE YEAR FOR AURORAS: Did you know that March is the best month of the year for auroras? It's true. A 75-year study shows that March has more geomagnetically active days than any other month of the year. (October is a close second.) This is due to the Russell-McPherron effect. In short, cracks tend to form in Earth's magnetosphere during weeks around equinoxes, allowing solar wind to spark Northern Lights. Aurora alerts: SMS Text COMET 12P IS COMING TO LIFE: With a new ice-geyser outburst on Feb. 29th, Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks has crossed the threshold of binocular visibility. "It is now a 6th-magnitude object," reports Michael Jaeger, who made this 1-hour animation on March 2nd: "It was easy to see in my 6x30 viewfinder," he says. "The view reminded me of galaxy M13 with a 0.5° tail." Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks is "cryovolcanic." Its surface is dotted with geysers which spew a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons and dissolved gasses when they are warmed by sunlight. There have been at least 6 significant eruptions since last December, one of them an incredible 5 magnitudes: light curve. Right now, 12P is approaching the sun for a close encounter in April. Between now and then, forecasters expect 12P to brighten 10- to 15-fold, making it a naked-eye object at 3rd to 4th magnitude. This would be true even without any special geyser activity; the whole comet is sizzling as it approaches the sun. If any geysers do erupt in the weeks ahead, it could push the comet to even greater brightness. Comet 12P has received a lot of attention because it could be visible during the April 8th solar eclipse. During totality, the comet will be close to Jupiter, both about 30 degrees from the eclipsed sun: If the brightness of 12P peaks around 3rd or 4th magnitude, as predicted, it will not be visible to the naked eye in the twilight-darkness of the Moon's shadow. However, it should be an easy target for cameras. Indeed, many people taking wide angle photos of the eclipse will catch it by accident. May it continue to brighten! more images: from Georg Klingersberger of Kobernaußen, Austria; from Gerald Rhemann of Nerpio, Spain; from the Association Astronomique de l'Indre of Le Poinconnet, Indre, Centre Val de Loire, France; from Chris Schur of Happy Jack, AZ; from José J.

On Jan. 26, 2024, the students of Earth to Sky Calculus launched this locket to the stratosphere onboard a cosmic ray research balloon. At the apex of the flight, it floated 111,535 feet above the Sierra Nevada mountains of central California: Buy it now for $149.95, and we'll fly it again--FOR FREE--during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. The students will be launching multiple balloons from the path of totality in Texas. Your pendant will go along for the ride, touching the shadow of the Moon at the edge of space. (Simply type "FLY IT AGAIN" in the comments box at checkout.) The locket, which opens to hold a personal photo or other small item, comes with a greeting card showing the jewelry in flight and telling the story of its journey to the edge of space.

Automated software maintained by NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office calculates their orbits, velocity, penetration depth in Earth's atmosphere and many other characteristics. Daily results are presented here on Spaceweather.com. On Mar 5, 2024, the network reported 9 fireballs.

Cosmic Rays in the Atmosphere SPACE WEATHER BALLOON DATA: Almost once a week, Spaceweather.com and the students of Earth to Sky Calculus fly space weather balloons to the stratosphere over California. These balloons are equipped with sensors that detect secondary cosmic rays, a form of radiation from space that can penetrate all the way down to Earth's surface. Our monitoring program has been underway without interruption for 7 years, resulting in a unique dataset of in situ atmospheric measurements. Latest results (July 2022): Atmospheric radiation is decreasing in 2022. Our latest measurements in July 2022 registered a 6-year low: What's going on? Ironically, the radiation drop is caused by increasing solar activity. Solar Cycle 25 has roared to life faster than forecasters expected. The sun's strengthening and increasingly tangled magnetic field repels cosmic rays from deep space. In addition, solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) sweep aside cosmic rays, causing sharp reductions called "Forbush Decreases." The two effects blend together to bring daily radiation levels down. .Who cares? Cosmic rays are a surprisingly "down to Earth" form of space weather. They can alter the chemistry of the atmosphere, trigger lightning, and penetrate commercial airplanes. According to a study from the Harvard T.H. Chan school of public health, crews of aircraft have higher rates of cancer than the general population. The researchers listed cosmic rays, irregular sleep habits, and chemical contaminants as leading risk factors. A number of controversial studies (#1, #2, #3, #4) go even further, linking cosmic rays with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Technical notes: The radiation sensors onboard our helium balloons detect X-rays and gamma-rays in the energy range 10 keV to 20 MeV. These energies span the range of medical X-ray machines and airport security scanners. Data points in the graph labeled "Stratospheric Radiation" correspond to the peak of the Regener-Pfotzer maximum, which lies about 67,000 feet above central California. When cosmic rays crash into Earth's atmosphere, they produce a spray of secondary particles that is most intense at the entrance to the stratosphere. Physicists Eric Regener and Georg Pfotzer discovered the maximum using balloons in the 1930s and it is what we are measuring today.
