Model organisms are useful for the discovery of new genetic diseases and key to understanding variant effects, and modelling a disease gene in a genetic model means that researchers can perform an in-depth exploration of gene or variant function. The GSA Journals are pleased to publish a series highlighting ongoing advances in rare disease discovery and mechanisms by presenting key research findings and new discoveries.Read now Plant Genetics and Genomics Plant science has generated many discoveries and advances in genetics and genomics research. These contributions reflect the ingenuity and rigor of the plant science community, as well as the rich diversity of plants and their biology. To showcase this critical work, GENETICS and G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics has launched the Plant Genetics and Genomics series with a collection of fourteen research articles and an accompanying editorial.Read now Neurogenetics Neurogenetics lies at the intersection of Neuroscience and Genetics, where genetic approaches are applied to the study of nervous system development, function, and plasticity. Overseen by Series Editors Oliver Hobert, Cecilia Moens, and Kate O’Connor Giles, this new series aims to make the GSA Journals a home for cutting-edge, robust research in neurogenetics.Read now Fungal Genetics and Genomics The fungal kingdom is remarkable in its breadth and depth of impact on global health, agriculture, biodiversity, ecology, manufacturing, and biomedical research. Overseen by editors Leah Cowen and Joseph Heitman, this series aims to report and thereby further stimulate advances in genetics and genomics across a diversity of fungal species.Read now FlyBook FlyBook from GENETICS is a comprehensive compendium of review articles presenting the current state of knowledge in Drosophila research.Browse FlyBook WormBook WormBook from GENETICS features a comprehensive compendium of review articles presenting the current state of knowledge in C. elegans research.
