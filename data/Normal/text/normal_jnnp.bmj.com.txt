Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry (JNNP)'s ambition is to publish the most ground-breaking and cutting-edge research from around the world. Encompassing the entire genre of neurological sciences, our focus is on the common disorders (stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, subarachnoid haemorrhage and neuropsychiatry), but with a keen interest in the Gordian knots that present themselves in the field, such as ALS. With early online publication, regular podcasts and an immense archive collection, JNNP is a trail-blazer and not a follower. Subscribers to JNNP also have access to Practical Neurology and the Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery. JNNP has a fully open access companion journal, BMJ Neurology Open, publishing research in all areas of clinical neurology and neuroscience. JNNP publishes regular podcasts discussing highlights from its issues. Subscribe in all podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Stitcher and Spotify.
