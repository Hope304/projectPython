YC helps their companies a lot, and the YC community is a huge asset for the companies that go through the program."Ron Conway,Founder, SV Angel"At YC, we were challenged to do things that don't scale – to start with the perfect experience for one person, then work backwards and scale it to 100 people who love us. This was the best piece of advice we've ever received."Brian Chesky,Founder, Airbnb (YC W09)"I doubt that Stripe would have worked without YC. It's that simple.
