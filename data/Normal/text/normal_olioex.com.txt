Your spare stuff explains Hear why our community loves Olio An amazing community I started using Olio because we needed items for our newborn. After a few collections I discovered what a wonderful group of Olio-ers there are close to me. It’s amazing how connected my family are with our community now, and we’ve been sharing flyers locally to help introduce even more people to Olio. I’ve felt a real sense of accomplishment completing Food Waste Hero pick ups too. It’s wonderful knowing I’m playing a part in reducing waste. Sarah Oliver Olio-er Exactly what me and my family needed Hi 👋🏻 I’m Chloe Just wanted to come and say Hi 🙂 I’m new here and just wanted to share what a positive experience I’ve had on this app so far. In a cost of living crisis this app has been exactly what me and my family needed with the added bonus of reducing food waste which is a massive problem in this country 🙂 I couldn’t be more grateful for the volunteers who take time out of their day to collect and fairly distribute the food. ❤️ Chloe Johnson Olio-er A fulfilling experience I find being an Ambassador for Olio a really fulfilling role. I love getting out and about talking to people about how they can reduce waste and introducing them to the Olio community. It’s such a great way to do your bit and help out people in your local community. Lito Smith Olio-er Wonderful people Wow, Olio is a godsend. I have met some wonderful kind people along the way while getting some wonderful food and items.
