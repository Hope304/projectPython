I really like how it takes to account a variety of factors when asking about symptoms. Don't expect it to replace professional medical diagnosis tho!”“Well I have had a very rare disease since birth so I decided to see if it could guess it and it got it right! I was very surprised, it said only 9 out of 10,000 people get it and it still guessed it. I recommend this app very much.”“I had a really bad ear infection that lasted a while so I put my symptoms in on this app. It asked me a lot of questions and told me that my symptoms could be a busted eardrum. I didn’t believe it at first. I went to a doctor later that month and they told me that my right eardrum was busted.”These are unaltered publicly available third-party statements and not claims from Ada.Most popular symptom assessment appOptimized with human doctorsMedical guidance in your languageSupporting pandemic responsesMost comprehensive condition coverageAlicia MehlMedical Product Lead, DataDr. Chi-Yu LiuMedical Quality SpecialistDr. Kirsten GrayMedical Product Lead, Medical PlatformDr. Michal StebnickiSenior Medical Knowledge EngineerDr. Claire NovorolCo-founder & Chief Medical OfficerEwelina TürkSVP Medical ProductDr. Shubhanan UpadhyayDirector of Medical QualityDr. Adel BaluchDirector of Medical AffairsAlicia MehlMedical Product Lead, DataDr. Chi-Yu LiuMedical Quality SpecialistDr. Kirsten GrayMedical Product Lead, Medical PlatformDr. Michal StebnickiSenior Medical Knowledge EngineerDr. Claire NovorolCo-founder & Chief Medical OfficerEwelina TürkSVP Medical ProductDr. Shubhanan UpadhyayDirector of Medical QualityDr. Adel BaluchDirector of Medical AffairsAlicia MehlMedical Product Lead, DataDr. Chi-Yu LiuMedical Quality SpecialistDr. Kirsten GrayMedical Product Lead, Medical PlatformDr. Michal StebnickiSenior Medical Knowledge EngineerMedical quality is in our DNAThere are no shortcuts to becoming a qualified doctor, and there are no shortcuts to developing an AI that raises the bar for clinical accuracy, user accessibility, and industry regulation.Keep yourself informedAchieving EU-MDR certificationWhy European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is important and what our Class IIa classification means for Ada.Read moreMeasuring medical qualityIt's not enough to simply claim digital products are effective and safe.
