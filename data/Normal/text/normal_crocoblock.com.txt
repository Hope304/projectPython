They enable me to do much and save me from having to fork out for loads of different plugins for the vast number of different jobs that can be done with them. What I found that turned Crocoblock from a very useful suite of plugins to an absolutely essential purchase was the amazing support team that they have: they're always quick to answer any questions I have and how to go about doing the more complicated tasks using their plugins. They always respond in a timely manner and almost always solve any issues I'm having.
