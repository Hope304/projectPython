Chris Hare: Can you please introduce yourself, Miriam? Tell us a bit about who you are and what your connection is to the topic of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. What challenges have you faced in the workplace and how did you overcome them? Miriam Saffer: I never intended to have a career in DEI&B, and I don’t think it ever occurred to me that I’d have a personal connection either! I started my career in teaching, and I absolutely loved working with young people with special educational needs. Having found school pretty tough myself, I found myself able to connect with my students and felt that I was really able to make a difference.StoryFeb 29, 2024Empowering women in cybersecurity through eSports: The Wicked6 Initiative.As we celebrate Women's History Month, we must also acknowledge and address the existing gender gap in cybersecurity.

One such event that strives to pave the way for greater female participation and empowerment in the global cyber workforce is Wicked6.StoryFeb 29, 2024Creating Connections: Embracing change.It's getting to be that time of year when I am ready for change.

One reason people tend to forget the human element in cybersecurity is the increasing reliance on and trust in advanced technologies.
