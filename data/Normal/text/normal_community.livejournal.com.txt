What is a Community? A community is basically a journal run by a member of LiveJournal for people with common interests. Communities are free to use and create - anyone can have them, and they're easy to set up, too! LiveJournal Communities cover topics from Anime to Zen Buddhism, from Astronomy to Zim. You'll also find regional communities for places all around the world. There's probably a LiveJournal community for where you live too! How do I create my own Community? There is a FAQ that will explain how to create your very own community. There are also two FAQ Categories (General Community FAQs and Community Management FAQs) covering just about everything you'll ever need to know about communities. If you still need more information, feel free to submit a support request. How do I find other Communities? At this time there are two official LiveJournal Communities specifically created to help you find the community you're looking for.
