Most other fertility apps assume your cycle is 28 days long. This means the fertile window they give you is not tailored to you. Our algorithm significantly reduces the risk of you being assigned an incorrect fertile day as it uses your personal data. This reduces the risk of unwanted pregnancy, or can help you plan pregnancy with greater precision. While some fertility apps make money from selling data for advertising, we never have, and we never will, sell our users’ data.
