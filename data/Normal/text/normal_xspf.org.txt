It is portable. You should be able to carry a playlist from one place to another. It is well-engineered. Most playlist formats have bugs that make life harder for programmers and users. It is free (as in liberty) and open. No proprietary lock-in. Need JSON instead of XML? Use JSPF, the JSON Shareable Playlist Format. The Xiph OSC and XSPF logos are trademarks of Xiph.Org.
