HVAC cooling systems consume approximately 40% of a data center’s electricity. These systems traditionally use air conditioning, air handling and fans to cool the data center facility and IT equipment, ultimately resulting in high energy consumption and high carbon emissions. Data centers are moving to direct liquid cooled (DLC) systems to improve cooling efficiency thus lowering their PUE, operating expenses (OPEX) and carbon footprint. This paper describes how CoolIT Systems (CoolIT) meets the need for improved energy efficiency in data centers and includes case studies that show how CoolIT’s DLC solutions improve energy efficiency, increase rack density, lower OPEX, and enable sustainability programs. CoolIT is the global market and innovation leader in scalable DLC solutions for the world’s most demanding computing environments. CoolIT’s end-to-end solutions meet the rising demand in cooling and the rising demand for energy efficiency.

Divergent uses new manufacturing solutions and their Divergent Adaptive Production System (DAPS™) software to make vehicle manufacturing more efficient, less costly and decrease manufacturing waste by replacing existing design and production processes.Divergent initially used on-premises workstations to run HPC simulations but faced challenges because their workstations could not achieve fast enough simulation times. Divergent also needed to free staff from managing the HPC system, CAE integration and IT update tasks.
