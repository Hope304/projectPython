Tonight I was nervous about attending a virtual job fair. I jumped in and gleaned valuable information. Thank you #JeffPatterson. #AirMeet was very user friendly. Signed in and headed to the Lounge where so many edtechers were eagerly sharing relevant and useful information about the industry. Thank you Formative‚Äôs Sara Cowley, CSM for the phenomenal insight on EdTech careers such as customer success managers and onboarding. Key takeaway: 1.
