"Crownsmen Partners have the most detailed, thoughtful, interview process I have seen. I have been on CNN International, The Today Show, NBC and others and no one gets into the details like they do. Only the New Yorker goes into this kind of detail and thoroughly explores the issues. I highly recommend working with them. Great work!"Eric Beckwitt / Founder & CEOFreightera"The Crownsmen Podcast was a great opportunity to showcase Otter Co-op and the Co-op Retailing system to other business professionals.
