We want to save our users from Googling for information! We want to make our users more efficient and productive by providing them with easy access to information and the necessary utilities. We want to become your one-stop shop for anything related to vulnerabilities. Instead of using 20 different tools and 50 web sites, you should only need CVEdetails. See updates and change log for more information. Feel free to reach us at admin@cvedetails.com if you have any questions/concerns or feedback. Why do you need vulnerability intelligence? Using a house analogy, your house have many doors and windows, and there will always be burglars and other parties with bad intentions outside. To secure your house, you first need to know how many windows and doors you have (attack surface), if your doors and windows are secured properly and if they can be opened due to some defects in your locks or similar (vulnerability intelligence). Existence of burglars in your neighbourhood or whether burglars are targeting specific lock types etc (threat intelligence) won't help much unless you keep your house secure. Even if you track every single known burglar, given the opportunity, some random person, even without prior experience, may break into your house. We understand that you need to keep up with everything with limited time and resources! We are here to make life easier for you.
