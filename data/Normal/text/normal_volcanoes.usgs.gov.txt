public safety and minimize social and economic disruption from volcanic unrest and eruption through our National Volcano Early Warning System. We deliver forecasts, warnings, and information about volcano hazards based on a scientific understanding of volcanic behavior. Learn more about NVEWS Volcano Activity Notifications USGS Volcano Observatories release regular updates and notifications to communicate increases or decreases in volcanic activity and explain unusual or hazardous circumstances. Get Latest Updates Volcano Hazards Assessments Long-term hazards assessments identify locations at risk from volcanic hazards. They are released as high-resolution hazards-zonation maps with accompanying explanations, which help guide eruption preparedness plans. View Assessments U.S. Volcano Observatories Volcano Observatory staff monitor, research, and issue formal notices of activity for volcanoes in assigned geographic areas. Scientists also assess volcano hazards and work with communities to prepare for volcanic eruptions.

The 2018 eruption of Hawai‘i's Kīlauea Volcano was the first volcanic crisis event in which communication via the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) social media group, “USGS Volcanoes,” Authors Robert T. Goldman, Sara McBride, Wendy K. Stovall, David Damby By Volcano Hazards Program, Volcano Science Center February 15, 2024 Lava flow impacts on the built environment: Insights from a new global dataset The recent destruction of thousands of homes by lava flows from La Palma volcano, Canary Islands, and Nyiragongo volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo, serves as a reminder of the devastating impact that lava flows can have on communities living in volcanically active regions. Damage to buildings and infrastructure can have widespread and long-lasting effects on rehabilitation and livelihoods. Our Authors Elinor S. Meredith, Susanna F. Jenkins, Josh L. Hayes, David Lallemand, Natalia Irma Deligne, Natalie Teng Rui Xue By Volcano Hazards Program, Volcano Science Center February 5, 2024 Stress-driven recurrence and precursory moment-rate surge in caldera collapse earthquakes Predicting the recurrence times of earthquakes and understanding the physical processes that immediately precede them are two outstanding problems in seismology. Although geodetic measurements record elastic strain accumulation, most faults have recurrence intervals longer than available measurements. Foreshocks provide the principal observations of processes before mainshocks, but variability bet Authors Paul Segall, Mark V. Matthews, David R. Shelly, Taiyi Wang, Kyle R.
