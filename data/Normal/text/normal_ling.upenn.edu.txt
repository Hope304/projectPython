Linguistics is also concerned with how languages are learned and used, how they vary and change, and the relationship of language to cognition, biology, and society. The Department of Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania has a longstanding reputation for using diverse kinds of empirical data to advance linguistic theory. Known for its interdisciplinary research, the department not only spans the subfields of linguistics but also connects with many other fields in cognitive science and beyond.
