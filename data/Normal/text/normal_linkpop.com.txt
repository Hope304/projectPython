These sites have short bio sections and don’t allow users to include links in the description of individual posts. So when someone writes “link in bio” in a post, they’re directing you to their profile bio, where you’ll find a link to more information outside of the platform.Today, we refer to link in bio as the place to upload and connect all your top links with just one URL. For example, a foodie influencer posts a photo of a delicious recipe they created, then writes “link in bio” in the post. You’ll be able to go to their profile bio, click the link in bio URL, and see the full step-by-step recipe on their website or YouTube channel (or wherever they lead you!). Link in bio tools have been a total game-changer for sharing content with your visitors and followers.Where can you use a link in bio tool?Link in bio tools are specially designed for social media sites like Instagram and TikTok, where you can’t place links in the body of your posts, and you have a limited amount of space inside your profile bio. But now you can use a link in bio tool anywhere you want! Get creative by adding a unique QR code that sends followers to your link in bio page. You can also use the same QR code on your business card, printed poster…even a t-shirt.Can you put a link in your TikTok bio?You bet. In the past, this was a limited feature that TikTok only allowed certain users to do. But now, anyone can add a link to their TikTok bio. To do it, make sure you switch your TikTok to a Business Account if you haven’t already done so. Then click ‘Edit profile’ and paste your link in bio URL into the ‘Website’ section. Click ‘Save’ and you’re done. Easy.Who uses links in bio tools?Anyone trying to build their audience and presence online should use a link in bio tool.
